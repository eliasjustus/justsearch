/**
 * All three stages of the VDU abstention cascade (tempdoc 677 §Proposed design): pure, stateless
 * verdict logic deciding whether a page/document's vision-extraction output should be trusted.
 *
 * <p><b>Stage 0 — input legibility</b> ({@link #inputVerdict}): a per-page check on raw pixel
 * signals, before any model call. <b>CAUTION (quoted from the tempdoc, verbatim):</b> "the gate
 * must key on 'no textual signal present for anything' (blur/contrast floor), not 'OCR confidence
 * low', or it would defeat VDU's purpose." {@link #LAPLACIAN_FLOOR} / {@link #CONTRAST_FLOOR} are
 * therefore deliberately conservative — Stage 0 must only catch pages carrying no textual signal
 * at all (blank/blown-out/uniformly-flat), not merely hard-to-read ones; a stray ambiguous case
 * must fall through to Stage 1, not get silently abstained here. <b>PROVISIONAL:</b> unlike
 * Stages 1/2 below, these two floors have not been through the 2026-07-11 calibration pass (that
 * pass targeted output-side confidence signals, not input-pixel signals) — they remain a
 * conservative starting point.
 *
 * <p><b>Stage 1 — same-call output confidence</b> ({@link #outputVerdict}): a document-level
 * three-band check on the signals returned alongside the model's own Pass 1 output (mean
 * logprob, low-confidence-token fraction, finish reason). {@link Band#REJECT} abstains outright;
 * {@link Band#AMBIGUOUS} defers to Stage 2 (the caller — {@code VduProcessor} — must re-sample
 * before deciding); {@link Band#PASS} trusts the output as-is.
 *
 * <p><b>CALIBRATED (2026-07-11 harness, tempdoc 677 §Calibration):</b> {@link
 * #REJECT_MEAN_LOGPROB_FLOOR}, {@link #REJECT_LOW_CONFIDENCE_FRACTION_CEILING}, {@link
 * #AMBIGUOUS_MEAN_LOGPROB_FLOOR}, {@link #AMBIGUOUS_LOW_CONFIDENCE_FRACTION_CEILING}, and {@link
 * #AGREEMENT_FLOOR} are derived from a live llama-server (Qwen3.5-9B) run over {@code
 * golden/synth-scan-v1} (n=30 confabulated documents) and a legible fixture set (n=16), not first-cut
 * guesses:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>legible (n=16):</b> meanLogprob ∈ [-0.058, -0.006], lowConfidenceFraction = 0.000 (all
 *       16), re-sample (Stage 2) agreement = 1.000 (all 16).
 *   <li><b>confabulated, SHORT/refusal-shaped mode (22/30):</b> meanLogprob ≤ -0.41,
 *       lowConfidenceFraction ≥ 0.07 — comfortably caught by the REJECT arm.
 *   <li><b>confabulated, LONG/confident mode (8/30 — the mode that evades a naive Stage 1
 *       floor):</b> meanLogprob ∈ [-0.25, -0.049], lowConfidenceFraction ∈ [0.013, 0.048];
 *       re-sample agreement 0.047-0.239 (vs. legible 1.000; short-confab-mode agreement
 *       0.231-0.379). This is the population {@link #AMBIGUOUS_LOW_CONFIDENCE_FRACTION_CEILING}
 *       (0.005) is tuned to catch: every one of the 8 has lowConfidenceFraction ≥ 0.013, well
 *       above the legible population's flat 0.000, so the AMBIGUOUS band always fires for this
 *       mode even on the sub-cases whose meanLogprob alone (as high as -0.049) would clear {@link
 *       #AMBIGUOUS_MEAN_LOGPROB_FLOOR}. Stage 2's re-sample agreement (max 0.239) then separates
 *       these from a genuinely legible page (1.000) with wide margin.
 * </ul>
