/**
 * Tempdoc 561 P-E — the PASSIVE (answer-plane) learning producer. A {@link StreamConsumer} wired onto
 * the chat / RAG-ask shapes: at the end of a turn it scans the user's message for an explicit,
 * high-precision memory cue ("remember that …", "note that …", "I prefer …", "my … is …", "call me
 * …") and persists the durable fact into the single-authority {@link MemoryStore} the user inspects +
 * forgets via {@code /api/memory} — so the answer plane contributes to memory too, not just the agent.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately a precise heuristic, not a per-turn LLM extraction call: per 559 §15 cost-realism an
 * extra inference round-trip on every chat turn is a poor trade. The id is a content hash, so restating
 * the same preference does not create a duplicate ({@code MemoryStore.remember} is idempotent on id).
 * A richer LLM-based semantic extractor is a documented evolution (it would thread an inference client
 * + a token budget into this consumer).

  /**
   * Tempdoc 734 round-14 F4 (chat plane) applied to the PASSIVE plane. This method used to catch every
   * {@link RuntimeException} and drop it, so while the data key was locked every write threw and
   * passive learning silently recorded nothing — the accepted-and-dropped shape F4 closed on the chat
   * path, one plane over.
   *
   * <p>The chat plane's answer (a user-facing 423 refusal) is the WRONG shape here: this is background
   * work on a turn the user did not ask to be recorded, and refusing the turn over it would break a
   * conversation that is otherwise serviceable. So the drop stays a drop — but it stops being SILENT
   * ({@link #lockedEpisodeReported}), and it stops being paid for: {@link MemoryStore#isLocked()}
   * (tempdoc 806 W1) is consulted before the write instead of discovering the lock by exception.
   *
   * <p>The WARN is only raised when a fact WOULD have been stored. The cue scan is a pure string scan —
   * no IO, no inference — so running it first costs nothing and is what makes the report witnessed:
   * "we skipped something" is a claim, and on a turn with no memory cue nothing was skipped.
   *
   * <p><b>Recovery story (no queue, deliberately).</b> There is no deferred-retry buffer and this
   * change does not add one: the record id is a content hash and {@code remember} is idempotent on it,
   * so a fact restated after unlock lands exactly once, and the consumer re-fires on every subsequent
   * turn — the natural retry seam is the conversation itself. A fact stated ONLY while locked is lost,
   * which is why the WARN exists: the loss is visible rather than inferred. Note the narrow window
   * this occupies — {@code ConversationEngine.wouldDiscardWhileLocked} already refuses any dispatch
   * that would persist a conversation record while locked, so the turns that reach here at all are the
   * ephemeral ones that persist nothing else.
