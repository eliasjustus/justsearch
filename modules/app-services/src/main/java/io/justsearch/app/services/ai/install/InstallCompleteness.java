/**
 * Pure per-FILE install-completeness decision (tempdoc 805 G.3 W-TRUTH).
 *
 * <p>Four authorities meet here and each answers exactly one question:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the <b>registry × profile</b> (via {@link InstallPlan}) — what is required now;
 *   <li><b>disk</b> (via the planner's own already-installed probe) — what is actually present: a
 *       required file is missing iff the plan still wants to download it;
 *   <li>the <b>{@link InstallContract}</b> — what the run that installed this machine claimed, at
 *       file granularity ({@code InstalledModel.installedFiles});
 *   <li>the <b>declined set</b> — what the user currently does not want (tempdoc 840 Phase 2).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The declined set is INTENT, not the record.</b> It arrives as a parameter, read by the
 * service from settings; this function stays pure. It is deliberately the user's <em>current</em>
 * preference and not the contract's historical {@code SkipCause.USER_DECLINED}: if a user declines
 * the reranker today and re-enables it next month, intent flips and its missing files become a
 * real, offerable gap again. Reading the contract instead would freeze the old decision forever.
 *
 * <p>The resulting classification per missing file:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code MISSING_CONTRACTED} — the contract named this file as installed and it is gone. A
 *       real gap: {@code installedFully} must read false.
 *   <li>{@code MISSING_UNCONTRACTED} — the contract never named this file, so its absence is a
 *       newer app version's registry addition, not retroactive non-installation. Reported as a
 *       pending registry addition.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Entry-kind rule (tempdoc 805 Part H, U3).</b> {@code ModelPackage.selectVariant} returns
 * null for a variantless package, so the contract writer recorded {@code cuda-runtime} as {@code
 * skipped("No variant")} with an EMPTY {@code installedFiles} list in both 0.1.0 and 0.2.0. A
 * skipped-kind entry therefore claims no files at all: its package's missing files classify as
 * {@code MISSING_UNCONTRACTED}. Round 11 read {@code installedFully:false} precisely because a
 * package-level {@code containsKey} matched that skipped entry and called it a contracted gap.
 *
 * <p>The same rule holds for an installed-kind entry: a file absent from its {@code installedFiles}
 * is uncontracted <em>even though the package is contracted</em> — the contract is a record of what
 * was installed, and it cannot have claimed a file that did not exist when it was written. This is
 * what makes the forward-fixed contract (see {@code AiInstallService.buildContract}, which now
 * records variantless-but-downloaded packages as installed-with-files) safe: adding per-file
 * authority for {@code cuda-runtime} does not turn a future added file into a false "real gap".
 *
 * <p>{@link #repairNeeded()} is deliberately independent of that classification: on a real upgraded
 * machine the missing ORT natives ARE registry additions, and repair must still be offered.
 * Contractedness decides only the {@code installedFully} truth claim and the additions list.
 *
 * <p><b>Required/optional axis (tempdoc 824 §3.3b).</b> A second, orthogonal axis runs beside
 * contractedness: whether the capability needs the file at all ({@code
 * InstallPlan.PlannedDownload.required}, carried from the registry). Round 16 lost an 872-byte
 * {@code splade/config.json} — a file no required-file list names and no resolver call site reads —
 * and the machine reported the same full-strength "a required component is missing" it would report
 * for a missing 500 MB model, while SPLADE was demonstrably serving on CUDA. So both truth claims
 * here count only REQUIRED files, and optional gaps get their own non-alarming list ({@link
 * #optionalGaps()}). This is strictly a relaxation on files that were never consumed as
 * requirements: for a required file every verdict is bit-for-bit what it was before.
