/**
 * Tempdoc 617 §10.8: model install is the primary path by which ~9 GB reaches AI Home, and it runs
 * on a virtual thread that outlives its HTTP request. The request-scoped mutation lease is
 * therefore already released while {@code DownloadExecutor.moveAtomicBestEffort} is still promoting
 * partial files into place, so without a lease of its own {@code POST /api/upgrade/prepare} reports
 * no blocker and the installer can launch mid-download — the outcome D2's "an update never touches
 * models" invariant exists to prevent.
