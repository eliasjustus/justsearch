/**
 * Tempdoc 865 §7.7 / §8.3 item 6 — the record projection's vocabulary must be EXHAUSTIVE over the
 * wire vocabulary.
 *
 * <p>The asymmetry this closes: every {@code AgentRunShape} kind is born durable on the wire, where
 * {@code AgentEventPayloads}' switches are over a SEALED interface and the compiler forces a
 * decision about each one — and born NON-durable in the record, where {@code
 * AgentInteractionMapper.fromRunEvent} switches over a {@code String} with a {@code default}, so
 * silence is the fallback. {@code budget_raised} was that asymmetry's output, not an oversight.
 *
 * <p>The compiler cannot help on the String switch, so this test is the enforcement: a kind added to
 * {@code AgentRunShape} and claimed by NEITHER list below fails the build, which is the same
 * two-site-agreement shape {@code AgentInteractionMapperTest.everyDeclaredPhaseConstantIsClassified}
 * already uses for the durable-progress phases. Deciding is cheap; the defect this prevents is a
 * kind whose durability nobody ever chose.
 *
 * <p><b>HONEST BOUNDARY — what this does NOT close.</b> It closes "a kind nobody wrote down
 * anywhere": every name {@code AgentRunShape} declares must appear in one of the two lists here, and
 * {@link #declaredNonProjectingNamesAreRealCasesInTheMapper} additionally binds the second list to
 * literal case labels in the mapper's source, so a name cannot be parked here while silently
 * reaching {@code default}. It does NOT verify the mapper's PROJECTING arm case-by-case (that is
 * {@code AgentInteractionMapperTest}'s job, per kind), and the {@code default} arm remains live and
 * necessary — this mapper also serves vocabularies {@code AgentRunShape} does not declare (the
 * workflow node journal, {@code search_executed}), so exhaustiveness here is exhaustiveness over ONE
 * vocabulary, not over the switch.
