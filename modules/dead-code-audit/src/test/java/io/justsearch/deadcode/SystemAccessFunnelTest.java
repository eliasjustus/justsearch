/**
 * The one repo-wide system-access funnel (tempdoc 883 decision 5).
 *
 * <p><b>What it asserts.</b> Every read of process-global state — {@code System.getenv},
 * {@code System.getProperty/setProperty/clearProperty}, and their two disguises
 * {@code Boolean.getBoolean} / {@code Integer.getInteger}, which are {@code System.getProperty}
 * with a parse — goes through {@code io.justsearch.configuration}, whose {@code EnvRegistry} /
 * {@code SystemAccess} / {@code ResolvedConfigBuilder} are the sanctioned funnel. Every site
 * outside that package must be listed in {@code gates/config-surface/sysaccess-allowlist.txt},
 * which is a RATCHET: a new site fails, and an entry whose site is gone must be deleted.
 *
 * <p><b>Why here.</b> This replaces six per-module ArchUnit rules
 * ({@code app-api/ArchitectureRulesTest}, {@code core/ArchUnitSanityTest},
 * {@code app-services/AppServicesWorkerGuardrailsTest}, {@code indexer-worker/IndexerWorkerGuardrailsTest},
 * {@code ui/UiApiGuardrailsTest}, {@code adapters-lucene/AdaptersLuceneGuardrailsTest}) whose
 * union left {@code telemetry}, {@code app-inference}, {@code gpu-bridge}, {@code ai-backend},
 * {@code app-launcher}, {@code ort-common}, {@code worker-services}, {@code benchmarks} and
 * {@code ssot-tools} uncovered — the modules holding a large share of the actual call sites. Six
 * rules that each had to be remembered when a module was added is the shape that produced that
 * gap; this module already imports every production module for the dead-code analysis, so it is
 * the one place where "repo-wide" is a property of the classpath rather than of a list someone
 * maintains.
 *
 * <p><b>Coverage is deliberately WIDER than the six rules it replaces.</b> Only
 * {@code UiApiGuardrailsTest} covered {@code clearProperty}, none covered
 * {@code Boolean.getBoolean} / {@code Integer.getInteger}, and one missed the no-arg
 * {@code System.getenv()}. Those gaps are closed here rather than reproduced; the extra sites are
 * seeded into the allowlist like the rest, so the widening costs entries, not red builds.
 *
 * <p><b>Honest limits.</b> (1) The allowlist RECORDS sites; it does not bless them. Shrinking it is
 * the point — every entry is a consumer that should be reading {@code ResolvedConfig} instead.
 * (2) Reflective access ({@code Method.invoke} onto {@code System}) is invisible to a bytecode
 * scan; none exists in this repo today. (3) The scan sees only classes the audited-module list in
 * {@code build.gradle.kts} puts on the classpath, so a NEW module is covered only once it is added
 * there — the same dependency the whole-program dead-code analysis already has.
