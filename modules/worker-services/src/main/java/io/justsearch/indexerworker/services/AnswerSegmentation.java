   * LanguageUtils} already uses supplies the block structure, and {@link BreakIterator} runs over
   * ONE block's text at a time, never across a block boundary. Segmenting the raw markdown as prose
   * fused wholesale (847 §S0-results, measured over 19 shapes): a terminal {@code .} followed by
   * whitespace and a marker (`- `, `* `, `&gt; `, `| `, `## `) suppresses the sentence boundary
   * entirely, so a whole bullet list, blockquote or table plus its lead-in paragraph became a single
   * key; inserting a blank line instead split the terminator off as an orphan {@code "."} key. Block
   * structure subsumes both — no marker blacklist to maintain.
   *
   * <p>{@link Locale#ROOT}, not {@code Locale.ENGLISH}: all measured shapes segment identically
   * under {@code en}/{@code root}/{@code ja}/{@code zh}, so the former locale was a per-language
   * lever in appearance only (HI-6).
   *
   * <p>Two residuals, both measured and both left alone. Abbreviations still split a sentence
   * ({@code "e.g."} ends one) — {@link BreakIterator}'s own limit, exhibited by a shape in
   * {@code AnswerSegmentationTest} rather than merely asserted. And a HARD line break becomes one
   * space here while the rendered DOM concatenates the text around {@code <br>} with no separator at
   * all, so the two tokenizations disagree at exactly that boundary; the renderer's prefix match
   * stops there and the mark is short or absent, never misplaced.
