 * workflow `<select>` focused (`views/UnifiedChatView.ts:3987`) a `j` press stole the element's
 * native type-ahead — so the union is a fix, not a widening for symmetry.
 *
 * Split from {@link deepActiveElement} so a caller that resolves its subject differently can reuse
 * the predicate without inheriting the descent: `KeybindingRegistry` asks where the event ORIGINATED

/**

 *   shortcut. The typing guard alone does not cover it: composition can be driven from a control the
 *   predicate correctly reports as non-editable.
 * - `repeat` — an auto-repeating key is one intent held down, not N intents. A global command fired
 *   per repeat flaps state (`Ctrl+D` bookmark on/off/on) or floods navigation.
 *
 * A SHARED helper rather than three copies (b2, the design's chosen half): `/` and the four `mod+…`
 * chords go through `KeybindingRegistry`, but `Shell.handleGlobalKey` is a raw `document`-capture
 * listener and `Sv3Main.onWindowKeydown`/`UnifiedChatView.onConversationKeydown` are raw `window`
 * listeners — adding the checks to the dispatcher alone would have created a FIFTH fork of the guard
 * set, which is the exact defect §2.2 is about. Routing every global chord through one dispatcher
 * (b1) is the better end state and is deferred, not done: see §3.2(b).
