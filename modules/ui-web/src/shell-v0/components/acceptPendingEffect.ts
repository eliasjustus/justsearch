/**
 * §32 #2B + tempdoc 550 C3 — shared accept helpers for the PendingEffect surfaces
 * (PendingEffectQueue, AgentActivityPanel).
 *
 * Centralises three concerns so the two components don't drift:
 *   - `operationRisk(effect)`: synchronous risk lookup for an invoke-operation
 *     effect (via the already-loaded operations catalog).
 *   - `needsTypedConfirm(effect)`: whether accepting needs the typed-confirm gesture.
 *   - `acceptPendingNow` / `acceptPendingWithConsent`: dispatch an accepted pending,
 *     optionally marking it user-consented.
 *
 * <p>Consent model (tempdoc 550 C3): the user's accept-after-typed-confirm sets a
 * `consented` flag on the invoke-operation effect. The Shell's dispatch
 * (`jf-invoke-operation` → `OperationClient.invokeWithConsent`) then recovers the backend's
 * 428 trust gate by approving the backend-issued `PendingAuthorization` by id and
 * re-invoking with the minted capsule. There is NO client-side capsule mint here — the FE
 * never asks the backend to mint for an arbitrary op; it can only approve what the backend
 * actually gated (closing the Tier-0 "approve an un-gated op" hole, WA-5). An agent's own
 * dispatch never sets `consented`, so the backend still gates it.
 *
 * Lives in components/ (not pending-effects/) because it depends on both
 * acceptPending and applyEffect — pending-effects must not import actions
 * (actions imports proposeEffect from pending-effects → would be a cycle).
