/**
 * matchCountLabel — Tempdoc 597 (funnel + mode-aware label) + Search Thread S1's
 * count-coherence fix: when MORE rows render than documents matched, the headline
 * now names both counts truthfully ("N results · M matched exactly") instead of
 * collapsing to a self-contradicting "M matches" above a longer row list (live
 * audit finding B1). The matched-count noun is also now singular at exactly 1
 * ("1 match", not "1 matches").
 *
 * Relocated from SearchSurface.searchTrace.test.ts's embedded
 * `SearchSurface.matchCountLabel` describe block (tempdoc 597 R-1 made that a thin
 * delegating static) to test the SHARED helper directly — the ONE authority both
 * SearchSurface and ResultsCard project the count label from. `SearchSurface.
 * matchCountLabel` forwards verbatim to this function and carries no logic of its
 * own, so it needs no separate test.
