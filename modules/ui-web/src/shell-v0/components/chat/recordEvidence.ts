/**
 * Tempdoc 847 S1 — the ONE `claimMatches` envelope → evidence authority.
 *
 * A grounded answer's per-sentence evidence arrives as ONE map: `StreamingCitationMatcher`
 * (`modules/app-services/.../conversation/spi/StreamingCitationMatcher.java:150,155-159`) hands the
 * SAME payload object to the live `rag.citation_matches` SSE event and to the done-payload entry
 * `ConversationEngine` persists on the assistant record. So the live envelope and the persisted one
 * are not two shapes to read two ways — they are one shape, and this module is the one reader.
 *
 * It exists because the producer gate (tempdoc 836 §4) was applied by a private method on ONE view.
 * A second render path needing the same conversion (search v3, 847 §2.3/§2.4) would have forked the
 * gate across two paths — precisely the 561 P-A divergence `isVerifiedProducer`'s own doc comment
 * says must not happen: the same payload marking differently in two windows, or live versus after a
 * reload. This is a PROJECTION of the envelope, not a second authority over it.
 *
 * The gate is applied to BOTH halves of the conversion, because both reach a grounding tier:
 *  - {@link claimsFromRecord} → `Claim.verifiedScore` → `claimsToCitations` → the inline `[n]` marks.
 *  - {@link matchesFromRecord} → `CitationMatch.similarity` → `sourceGrounding` → the SOURCES panel's
 *    per-source tier and "Grounds N sentences" line (`evidenceProjection.ts:611-644` reads
 *    `m.similarity` straight). Gating only the first left the marks honest and the panel not: the
 *    same cosine number that mints no mark still painted a verification tier beside the source.
