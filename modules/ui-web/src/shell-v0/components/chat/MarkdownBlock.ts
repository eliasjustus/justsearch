 * rule (S0: 18 markdown shapes → 64 keys, computed exactly):
 *
 * ```
 * eligible   ⟺  keyWordChars ≥ 4
 * accept run ⟺  matchedWordChars ≥ 2
 *            ∧  (keyWordChars − matchedWordChars) ≤ max(4, 0.4 × keyWordChars)
 *            ∧  [ if matchedWordChars < 4: the run is the only occurrence in the window ]
 * ```
 *
 * Why that shape rather than a ratio: the backend's `BreakIterator` fuses the NEXT list item's
 * ordinal onto a key, and that costs 1–2 characters — an absolute tax, which on a short list item
 * (`"No.\n13."`) is half the key. A pure ratio therefore rejects short items for a fixed-size
 * defect, so the slack is `max(4, 0.4 × …)`: "≥ 60 % of the key" above 10 word-chars, a constant
 * 4-character allowance below it. One formula, no new lever.
 *
 * The ≥ 4-character ELIGIBILITY floor is load-bearing for honesty, not a legacy carry-over: CJK
 * answers segment standalone ordinal keys (`"2."`), which match an arbitrary `[2]` token elsewhere
 * in the answer at 100 % coverage. The floor excludes those; the uniqueness clause closes the case
 * the floor cannot (a 4-character numeric key such as `"2026."`).
 *
 * Longest PREFIX rather than whole-key matching is what dissolves the fused tail: the key's tokens
 * run `… search 1 3 2` while the DOM's run `… search 1 3`, and the prefix covers everything but the
 * stray ordinal. It is robust in that direction only — a single foreign token at the key's HEAD
 * zeroes the match (a fence's info string is a class attribute, not text), which is the right
 * outcome there (a code block has no sentence to mark) but must not be generalized.
 *
 * Two known asymmetries, both failing CLOSED (no mark), recorded so neither is re-discovered as a
 * surprise: (1) the leading-token case above; (2) INTRAWORD emphasis — `**fast**est` segments as
 * `fast` + `est` in the key but as the single token `fastest` in the rendered DOM, so a key whose
 * FIRST word carries intraword emphasis matches nothing and that sentence goes unmarked. Both lose
 * a mark that was earned; neither places one that was not.

   * builds spans), and pinned by a test so a future refactor cannot let a span follow the marker.
   *
   * Tempdoc 869 C3 — and why it is COLOURLESS BY CONSTRUCTION. A tier-2 mark used to wear the
   * grounding tint because `.cite-ref`'s base rule carried it and only the two SUBDUED tiers stated
   * themselves, so "no tier class" resolved to the STRONGEST tier: the mark the cross-encoder never
   * verified painted itself the colour of the ones it did. The mint below therefore passes
   * `'source'`, which emits no `cite-*` grounding class at all — there is no tier to state — and the
   * base rule now paints a neutral ink. What the mark asserts rides on `title` and `data-cite-tier`,
