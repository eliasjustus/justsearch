       'padding-bottom' — in both the disclosure would abut the answer prose with nothing between
       them. The margin is declared HERE, on the block, because the block is what changed; pushing it
       onto each container would be four edits that can drift and a fifth mount site with none.
       Gap-bearing containers add it to their gap, which is the direction that is safe to be wrong in
       (the net box is still shorter than the card's was). The '[inline]' form is excluded: the run

       chevron, no box. The card declarations moved OFF the base rule rather than being overridden
       back off it, so neither form carries chrome it does not draw, and '[inline]' restates the one
       thing it does keep — the hairline rule that says "aside".
