/**
 * Tempdoc 869 §2.5 — the CONFORMANCE guard for `evidence-fe-markdown-block`, the registered
 * projection of `ContextCitation` (→ `RetrievalCitation` → `Citation`, via `claimsToCitations`) into
 * the answer's inline marks.
 *
 * This is where 869's invariants live, rather than paperwork beside them. The renderer is the one
 * surface where three upstream authorities meet — the verifier (a `Citation`'s similarity and
 * sentence span), the model (the literal `[n]` it wrote), and the frame (577 Move 3) — and every
 * class it mints must be traceable to exactly one of them:
 *
 *  - I-2 REACHABILITY (C2, redisposed by 867 §7): which citation-shaped text each frame may touch,
 *    and how. A ref that resolves to a source and was NOT verified is REMOVED from a sourced
 *    answer's prose — the owner's decision (867 family A), superseding 869's mute of the same ref;
 *    an unresolvable `[7]`, a parenthesised `(2)`, and a label the weave rendered are prose or
 *    evidence and stay. The `ungrounded` frame keeps 577's mute, predicate and wording unchanged.
 *  - I-2 ORDER: a literal the tier-2 upgrade claims is never stripped instead.
 *  - The muted span (ungrounded only) SAYS what it is — colour is not the carrier.
 *  - I-1 POSITION (C1): the model's literal is transparent to the weave and its whitespace is the
 *    model's, so a mark lands where the same text would put it with no literal written at all, and
 *    a strip leaves the prose the model's spacing rather than the renderer's.
 *  - I-1 COLOUR (C3): a mark's tier is a POSITIVE class. Tier 1 states its grounding; tier 2 states
 *    none, because none was measured — and "no class" therefore has to paint neutral, not strongest.
