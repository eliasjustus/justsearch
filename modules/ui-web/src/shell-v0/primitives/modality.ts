/**
 * ModalityController — tempdoc 574 Move 4 (the runtime-modality authority).
 *
 * The ONE place modal background-behaviour lives. §16 S9 / P5 found modal hosts each hand-rolled
 * (or omitted) the modality contract: scroll-lock was MISSING everywhere (0 sites), and focus-restore
 * was copy-pasted in 3 of 6 hosts (ElicitHost / EffectAuditLog / MacroDryRun, each commented
 * "residue #5") and absent in the rest. This controller makes the contract one authority every modal
 * host composes, so "a modal that doesn't lock background scroll / doesn't restore focus" is no longer
 * something each host must remember.
 *
 * Contract on {@link enter}: (a) save the currently-focused element; (b) lock background scroll
 * (reference-counted, so stacked modals release the lock only when the last closes). On {@link exit}:
 * release the scroll-lock and restore focus to the saved element. Native `<dialog>.showModal()` already
 * provides the background-`inert` + focus-trap + top-layer for the dialog-based hosts, so this
 * controller deliberately owns only the two facets the platform does NOT: scroll-lock + focus-restore
 * (the residue-#5 fix). Non-dialog hosts that need inert/trap should move to native `<dialog>` (the
 * structural fix that also drops their hand-picked z-index — S4), not re-hand-roll it here.
 *
 * Tempdoc 864 Layer 2(d) — the same depth count is ALSO the app's answer to "does a modal own the
 * screen right now?" ({@link modalOwnsFocus}). It was already the only thing in the app that knew,
 * and a global-key handler that asked a second source would be the fork §2.2 is about.

 * (§2.3). The live 2026-08-25 repro (leg L10): with the command palette open and focus on a control
 * inside it, a bare `j` fell through to `Sv3Main`'s window listener — which passed every guard it
 * has, because a non-editable control is not a typing target — and pulled real focus into the
 * transcript *underneath* the open palette, scrolling it to the top. Focus was then outside the
 * popup, so the palette's own Tab trap never saw the next `Tab` and focus walked out to `<body>`.
 *
 * Deliberately a state predicate rather than a DOM scan: walking every shadow root for
 * `[aria-modal]` on each keystroke is both expensive and a second answer to a question this module
 * already owns. Non-blocking dialogs (`ModalController.open({ nonBlocking: true })`) never enter, so
 * they do not claim the keyboard — which is what "non-blocking" means.
