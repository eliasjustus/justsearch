/**
 * ReceiptController — tempdoc 613 §6: the ONE authority for the in-control RECEIPT surface (#1).
 *
 * A RECEIPT is the acknowledgement of a direct, synchronous action on a specific control ("Copied",
 * "Exported N entries") — `locality: 'at-control'` in the routing model. The problem statement is
 * explicit that these are LOCAL receipts, "not a request for a global copy toast … short receipts
 * should not become permanent history." Routing them to the window toast channel is the mis-route
 * §6's `f` (`routePushSurface`) forbids.
 *
 * Before this, the only working receipt was bespoke (SearchSurface's `copyFlash` state). This is that
 * pattern lifted into one reusable ReactiveController so every receipt site shares one authority — a
 * transient in-element "✓ <message>" flash with a single timing/auto-clear policy. The HOST renders
 * the flash (a button swaps its label); the controller owns the state + timer.
 *
 * This is NOT a new surface kind (§7) — it gives the EXISTING receipt surface (#1 in 613 §1's
 * inventory, "the in-button flash; 602 R7") the single authority every other surface already has.
