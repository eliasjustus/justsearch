 * ambientStyles — tempdoc 574 Move 1/2 (the tree-wide AMBIENT facets, delivered into every
 * shadow root).
 *
 * The §15/§16 root cause: a Lit app is ~95 sealed shadow roots + one light-DOM `tokens.css` with
 * no adopted stylesheet, so presentation expressed through a shadow-non-crossing CSS mechanism
 * (pseudo-elements, selector rules, `@keyframes`) is a *false global* — defined once but applying
 * almost nowhere, which manufactures per-component forks (the scrollbar/selection/keyframes family).
 *
 * The fix has two halves by facet class (574 §16):
 *  - **Class-A** ambient facets that DO inherit (scrollbar-width/scrollbar-color, motion, z) live in
 *    `tokens.css :root` and reach every shadow root by platform inheritance — no adoption needed.
 *  - **Class-B** ambient facets with NO inherited form (this file) are adopted into every shadow root
 *    via the {@link JfElement} base (Move 1's delivery substrate), so they finally apply to shadow
 *    content. Every value is a token (tokens.css is the single source); this sheet carries STRUCTURE,
 *    never authored values.
 *
 * This is the host-owned channel 569 §2 / Move 4 names: components compose it by extending JfElement;
 * they cannot write to it. New ambient facets are added HERE (one place), never per component — the
 * `class-b-ambient` gate (Phase 5) forbids these constructs inside a component's own `static styles`.

     shadow-DOM scrollers at the default "auto" width (live-verified §15 gap). Setting ONLY the
     non-inherited width here — in this adopted sheet that reaches every shadow root — thins them too.
