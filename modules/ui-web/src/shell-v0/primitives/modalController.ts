 * ModalController — tempdoc 574 §22.G (Move 4: the FULL modal contract, BY CONSTRUCTION).
 *
 * §22.D's `check-modality-contract` gate caught a raw `showModal()` that did not COMPOSE a
 * `ModalityController` — but it could not check that `enter()`/`exit()` were actually CALLED, so a modal
 * could compose the controller yet still be half-wired (showModal without scroll-lock / focus-restore).
 * This controller closes that hole: it bundles the platform half (native `<dialog>.showModal()/close()` →
 * focus-trap + background `inert` + Top Layer) with the {@link ModalityController} half (scroll-lock +
 * focus-restore) into one atomic {@link open}/{@link close}, so a modal host composes ONE controller and
 * gets the WHOLE contract by construction — the modal sibling of `TransientController`.
