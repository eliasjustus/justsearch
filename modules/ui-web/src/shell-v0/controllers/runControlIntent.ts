/**
 * Tempdoc 565 §30 — the DIRECTION authority's ONE control-intent seam for the PER-RUN directives.
 *
 * The human's direction over a live agent run is a single channel of typed directives that act on the
 * run via its controller: `initiate` (the composer prompt → `send`), `interject` (the live-run steer
 * input → `steer`), and `halt` (the session stop → `cancelSession`; the composer's inline cancel does a
 * lighter `abortController.abort()` stream teardown, a distinct mechanism). Every run-control affordance in the agent
 * window dispatches THROUGH this function rather than poking the controller directly — so a hand-rolled
 * steer OR stop that bypasses the channel is exactly what the `steering-surfaces` register-gate forbids
 * (`scripts/ci/check-steering-arbitration.mjs` bans a direct `.steer(`/`cancelSession(` outside this
 * seam). The per-run affordances become projections of one model.
 *
 * Honest seam boundary: `set-posture` (the autonomy dial) is NOT a per-run controller directive — it is
 * the GLOBAL autonomy STORE (the established 561 P-D issuance channel: `setAutonomyLevel` +
 * `subscribeAutonomy`, which the controller then pushes to the live run). Posture is a peer channel the
 * run's gate CONSUMES, written by the dial directly; it is deliberately out of this per-run seam (folding
 * a global store into a per-run dispatch would be the conflation, not the unification).
