/**
 * The effective-context set for Search v3 (tempdoc 610, ported by 852 S2) — the PURE half.
 *
 * Tempdoc 610 gave the shipped window five acts over what the next prompt actually contains: rewind
 * the context to a turn (the FLOOR), clear it, COMPACT everything above the floor into a summary,
 * EDIT that summary, and hide a single message from the prompt while it stays in the transcript.
 * All five are live backend endpoints behind five shared store functions
 * (`state/conversationListStore.ts`), and this window imported none of them until now.
 *
 * What lives here is everything that can be decided without a DOM or a fetch: which turn a floor
 * names, which turns are consequently out of context, which are excluded, what a turn's menu may
 * offer, and the whole-prompt projection the shared context inspector renders. The window
 * ({@link SearchV3View}) owns the writes and the reload; the regions render what this returns.
 *
 * TWO LAWS THIS MODULE ENFORCES, both inherited from 852 S1:
 *
 * 1. **Ids come from {@link sv3TurnMessageIds} and nowhere else.** A turn reports a message id only
 *    when the CONVERSATION STORE minted it, so an affordance can never be pointed at an
 *    agent-run-plane id no `{floorMessageId}` or `/messages/{id}/exclude` endpoint would accept. A
 *    turn that names no store message therefore offers NO context affordance at all — the honest
 *    null, not a control that fails when pressed.
 * 2. **Message → turn resolution is BY ID** ({@link sv3TurnByMessageId}), never by position.
 *    `/history` counts rows `/api/thread` never emits (locked placeholders, system messages), so a
 *    floor resolved by index would attach to a neighbouring turn and look entirely plausible.
