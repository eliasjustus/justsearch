 * sv3-run — the Search v3 window's agent-run model (tempdoc 822 Phase F2).
 *
 * Derived from a third-party design system (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * Everything here is PURE — with ONE stated exception (tempdoc 859 §A §1.3): the live feed's TRAILING
 * reasoning item reads `ReasoningController.elapsedSeconds`, which reads `Date.now()`. That is the
 * same clock the reasoning block already renders its label from, and the controller's 1 s tick is what
 * re-derives the item; but "same input, same output" no longer holds unqualified for that one item,
 * and saying so is cheaper than a purity claim the code does not keep.
 *
 * It reads the shared `AgentSessionController` as a source, never as a place
 * to write: the run itself is hosted by that one controller (the 818 slice-3 finding that it is
 * framework-agnostic), and every directive the reader issues leaves through the ONE
 * `dispatchRunControl` seam in the window. This module exists so the window's RENDERING decisions are
 * derivations rather than a second run model.
 *
 * Four patterns from the design spec that it realizes:
 *
 *  1. **Two-axis run state → ONE derived phase.** A session status (what the shared controller says)
 *     and a turn state (what THIS window's own turn is doing) are separate facts; rendering reads the
 *     one value {@link deriveSv3RunPhase} derives from both. The window also holds an explicit
 *     `activeTurnId` (the {@link Sv3RunLocal} ref), which is what prevents the receipt-counted-from-
 *     the-wrong-origin class: the controller is a product-wide singleton, so "the run" is only ever
 *     the slice this window opened, addressed by the turn it opened it for.
 *  2. **The optimistic-handoff predicate** ({@link hasServerAcknowledgedLocalDispatch}) — a named,
 *     tested condition for when the local "Sending…" echo yields to server truth, instead of an
 *     implicit race. Deliberately NOT `runInFlight`/`isStreaming`: the controller sets both from
 *     inside `send()` before the server has said anything (`AgentSessionController.ts:1368-1370`), so
 *     they are local optimism too. Only evidence the SERVER produced counts.
 *  3. **The primary-action slot as a strict-priority state machine** ({@link sv3PrimaryAction}) —
 *     pending-question ▸ running ▸ follow-up ▸ send, exactly one control, the reason carried in the
 *     aria-label. F1 made "Stop renders INSTEAD of Send" structural; this extends the same rule to
 *     four rungs.
 *  4. **Typed pending states resolved by DEDICATED commands, never chat text** ({@link Sv3RunPrompt}).
 *     A held decision is a value with its own controls; the composer refuses a send while one is
 *     pending, so there is no path by which typing a sentence could resolve it.
 *
 * The feed projection is ONE pass ({@link projectSv3RunFeed}): the live feed renders its items and the
 * run's receipt counts them. The count therefore cannot come to describe a different set than the
 * cards on screen — the same construction the retired search-v2 window used for its receipt,
 * expressed as a projection both halves read.
