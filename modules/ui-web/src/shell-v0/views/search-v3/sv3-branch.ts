/**
 * Branch, edit / retry and the version pager for Search v3 (slice 513 + tempdoc 610 Phase A/B,
 * ported by 852 S3) — the PURE half.
 *
 * The shipped window builds all three of these on ONE backend act: `POST …/branch?fromMsgId=`
 * (`state/conversationListStore.ts` `branchConversation`, `ChatController.java:612-637`). There is
 * no edit endpoint and no retry endpoint — an edit is *branch from before this question, then send
 * the new text*, and a retry is the same with the old text (`views/UnifiedChatView.ts:1471-1497`,
 * `branchAndResend`). This module ports that ARITHMETIC, and nothing else: which message id each of
 * the three acts names, and which conversations are the versions of one turn.
 *
 * THREE LAWS, the first two inherited from 852 S1/S2 and the third from the reference:
 *
 * 1. **Ids come from {@link sv3TurnMessageIds} and nowhere else.** A turn reports a message id only
 *    when the CONVERSATION STORE minted it, so `?fromMsgId=` can never be handed an agent-run-plane
 *    id the endpoint would reject. A turn that names no store message offers NO branch affordance —
 *    the honest null, not a control that fails when pressed.
 * 2. **Message → turn resolution is BY ID** ({@link sv3TurnByMessageId}), never by position.
 * 3. **An edit forks from BEFORE the question, a branch forks from AFTER the answer.** They are two
 *    different ids on the same turn and confusing them is silent: an edit forked from the turn's own
 *    answer would inherit the very exchange the reader was replacing, and the transcript would look
 *    entirely plausible. {@link Sv3TurnLineage} carries both, named for what they do.
