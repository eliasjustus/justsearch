/**
 * The Search v3 window's MOVABLE BOUNDARIES — the sidebar's (tempdoc 822 Phase F5) and the citation
 * pane's (Phase F8), in one module because they are two halves of one arithmetic.
 *
 * (Renamed from `sv3-sidebar-sizing.ts` in F8: the moment a second boundary appeared, a file called
 * "sidebar sizing" holding the pane's ceiling would have been the name lying about the contents, and
 * two files would have been two places for the main column's 640 to drift apart in.)
 *
 * Derived from T3 Code (T3 Tools Inc., MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory. Every
 * number below is the donor's own, cited to the clone at `b73232bd`:
 *
 *  - sidebar default 16rem (`apps/web/src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx:27`, `threadSidebarWidth.ts:2`)
 *  - sidebar drag floor 13rem (`threadSidebarWidth.ts:3`)
 *  - collapsed icon rail 3rem (`sidebar.tsx:29`)
 *  - pane default 540px, floor 360px, ceiling share 70% (`PreviewPanelShell.tsx:12-19,42-49`)
 *  - pane inline/overlay switch 980px (`rightPanelLayout.ts:1`)
 *  - **neither ceiling is the region's own number.** `threadSidebarWidth.ts:4,6-11` derives the
 *    sidebar's from the MAIN pane's 40rem minimum: `max(sidebarMin, available - 640)`. A region may
 *    take everything that is not the main pane's honest reading width, and no more — the same shape
 *    as 818's L13 ("every movable boundary is clamped by the minimum honest forms on both sides"),
 *    which is why the two windows' rules agree without either importing the other.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS from the donor's arithmetic, and both are the donor's own rule applied
 * honestly (charter law 11, improve-don't-copy):
 *
 *  1. **The box is the WINDOW HOST, not the viewport.** The donor measures `window.innerWidth`
 *     because its sidebar+main wrapper IS the viewport (`AppSidebarLayout.tsx:148-149` beside
 *     `shouldAcceptWidth`'s `wrapper.clientWidth`, the same box there). Search v3 is a surface
 *     mounted INSIDE the shipped shell, so the viewport is wider than the box its regions share;
 *     deriving from the viewport would let the main pane fall under 640px — the exact thing the
 *     donor's rule exists to prevent. Callers pass the window host's own width, the donor's `wrapper`.
 *  2. **The pane is clamped by the main column too.** The donor has NO main-column clamp for its
 *     right panel — searched at `b73232bd`, absent: its pane may take 70vw beside an open sidebar and
 *     squeeze the conversation to nothing. Here {@link sv3PaneMaxWidth} subtracts the sidebar's
 *     CURRENT occupancy and the main column's 640 first, and {@link sv3SidebarMaxWidth} subtracts the
 *     pane's, so the reading column survives BOTH boundaries being pushed.
 *
 * The impure edge at the bottom is 818's L13 remember/reset asymmetry, and it is NOT a breach of
 * `sv3-sessions.ts`'s no-persistence rule: that rule is about SESSION RECORDS, whose authority is the
 * open Phase-D question. A sidebar width, a collapsed rail and a pane width are UI PREFERENCES about
 * this window's chrome — they describe no domain object, fork no authority, and have exactly the
 * durable home `views/search-v2/railSizing.ts:117-129` already chose for the same kind of value.
