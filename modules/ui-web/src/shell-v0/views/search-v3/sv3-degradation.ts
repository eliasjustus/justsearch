/**
 * sv3-degradation — the Search v3 window's ONE reduced-capability projection (inventory E1/E2/E3).
 *
 * The window had no degradation surface at all: a reader whose semantic leg had fallen back, or
 * whose local model was not running, saw a composer that quietly refused and nothing that named the
 * reason or offered a fix. This module supplies that fact, and it AUTHORS NONE OF IT — every word,
 * every cause and every remedy comes from the shared readiness authority (`state/readinessNotice.ts`,
 * bound to the backend's `LifecycleReasonCode` vocabulary by the `check-readiness-reason-codes`
 * gate). This window is a second CONSUMER of that vocabulary, never a second author, exactly as
 * `fixtures.ts` is for the unreachable wording.
 *
 * Three things live here and nowhere else in the window:
 *
 *  1. WHETHER there is anything to say — `warrantsSearchDegradationBanner`, the authority's own
 *     tier predicate, so an `info`-severity cosmetic gap does not buy warning-tier chrome in a
 *     window whose whole complaint was chrome volume.
 *  2. WHAT the causes are, KEYED ON THE REASON CODE rather than on its wording. The authority's
 *     `causes` are already scoped to the branch it took (a rebuild headline lists only the causes a
 *     rebuild clears); this projection keeps that scoping and re-attaches the CODE to each, so every
 *     downstream decision — dedup, the rebuild-headline restatement, the composer's overlap test —
 *     is made against an identifier the backend emits instead of against a sentence someone may
 *     re-word.
 *  3. WHERE the one-click fix is — as a NAVIGATION reference, per the convention `jf-control` and
 *     `jf-capability-map` already share (`components/Control.ts:391-395`): point at the surface the
 *     remedy lives on, never fire an operation out from under its consent ceremony.
 *
 * Pure data → data. The composer renders it and decides nothing, which is what keeps the wording
 * identical to the shipped window's.
