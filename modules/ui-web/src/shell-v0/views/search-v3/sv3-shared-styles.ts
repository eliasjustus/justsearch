 * sv3Shared — the stylesheet every Search v3 component adopts (tempdoc 822 slice 1).
 *
 * Derived from a third-party design system (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * Holds the constructs that a host-scoped token declaration cannot deliver, because they do not
 * inherit: keyframes are resolved per shadow root, so an `animation-name` referencing a keyframe
 * declared outside the root fails SILENTLY. Tokens stay in `sv3Tokens`; structure lives here.
 *
 * The looping indicators are duty-cycled: they hold at each extreme for ~40% of the cycle and ramp
 * in `steps()`, so the compositor draws a handful of discrete frames per cycle instead of one per
 * vsync — the difference between ~14 and ~288 updates on a 120Hz display, for indicators that a
 * local-first desktop app leaves on screen for hours.
