 * jf-sv3-session-row — the Search v3 sidebar's session row (tempdoc 822 slice 2).
 *
 * Derived from a third-party design system (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * ONE surface model for every row, per the design spec: the surface encodes INTERACTION (active,
 * selected, hover) and the content encodes STATUS. The spec tried the other way — elevated cards for live
 * threads, plain rows for settled ones — and recorded that it produced neither a hierarchy nor a
 * reliable hover cue.
 *
 * Precedence is written into the selectors, not into declaration order: the hover rule is GUARDED
 * out of the claimed states (`:host(:not([active]):not([selected]))`) so exactly one fill can ever
 * win. Declaration order alone would leave a later-added rule free to stack two fills.
 *
 * Status colour is a 3-budget: act-now, in-motion, broken. A resting row spends none
 * of it — its slot carries a muted timestamp instead, so colour keeps meaning "attend to this".
 *
 * The trailing slot SWAPS (tempdoc 822 Phase F3, extended to an action SET in tempdoc 831): status
 * at rest, the row's actions on hover or keyboard focus, hidden state out of flow, one width floor
 * so nothing jitters. With one exception, which is the whole reason the rule is quotable: an act-now
 * or broken status never yields — the spec's PR badge stays visible and clickable while the row is
 * hovered, and only the time label yields. Those two statuses are this window's honesty facts, so
 * the actions appear beside them instead of on top of them.
 *
 * Three actions, each backed by an operation the session list really has: rename (the F5 triad,
 * reached by pointer here and by F2 from the keyboard), pin (the F3 shelf move), and discard. The
 * discard is WITHHELD, not disabled, while work is in flight — a control that is present but inert
 * asks the reader to find out by pressing it.
 *
 * The RENAME is withheld the same way, on the same grounds, when no store session backs the
 * conversation (tempdoc 859 slice C PR-2, `store-backed`): a delegate conversation is persisted as
 * agent runs, and the rename endpoint writes to a `ConversationStore` session it has none of — so the
 * control would 404 rather than rename. Both gestures that reach the rename (double-click, F2) are
 * withheld with it: an affordance removed from the trailing slot and still reachable by keyboard
 * would be the same broken write behind a less visible door. The pin is LOCAL to this window and the
 * discard deletes the conversation's runs, so both stay.
 *
 * Side-effect registers <jf-sv3-session-row>.

         revealed 72px action set painted its icons over the tail of the title — 32px of text under
         the glyphs at the default sidebar width, at 2.91:1 against them (measured). A yielding row
         therefore widens its slot to the action set's width for exactly as long as the set is shown:
         the title truncates one ellipsis earlier while you are pointing at the row, and no glyph is
         ever composited under an icon.

         Widening the SLOT and not the label is what keeps this free of side effects — the slot is
         already the trailing reservation, so nothing moves but the title's clip. It is safe to do on
         hover here precisely because these are the rows whose slot content has yielded: there is no
         dot to move (that is why the never-yields rows keep their at-rest gutter instead).
