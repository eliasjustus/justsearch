/**
 * Tempdoc 859 §5a / Reach 1 — the record reader discriminates the PLANE, and never casts.
 *
 * `attributes.citations` carries two incompatible shapes: retrieval SOURCES on the answer plane
 * (`InteractionThreadController.chatTurn`) and per-sentence CITES on the action plane
 * (`AgentInteractionMapper`), whose sources live under a separate `sources` key. Reading the one key
 * without a discriminator is a silent reinterpretation, and a cast yields a confident wrong number
 * rather than an error — which is what a delegate turn's Sources affordance reported to the reader
 * (through its accessible name and the panel), never as a visible crash.
 *
 * No DOM: the projection is pure. The fixtures are real WIRE events, so every case runs through the
 * SHARED `projectUnifiedThread` on its way in, exactly as the sibling `sv3-record.test.ts` does.
