 * sv3-ask — the ONE ask-issuance site of the Search v3 window (tempdoc 822 Phase F1).
 *
 * Derived from a third-party design system (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * Every answer this window produces is dispatched from {@link sv3Ask} and nowhere else, and
 * `sv3-ask.forbid.test.ts` fails the build if a second `consumeShapeStream` caller appears in
 * `search-v3/`. That is the point: the shipped window's L9 defect is not that its 423 handling is
 * wrong, it is that ONE of its send paths dispatches without any — an asymmetry only a second
 * issuance site can have. With one site the refusal is structural: there is no second path to forget.
 *
 * Shared authorities consumed, not re-authored (the charter's "from-scratch components, shared
 * authorities"; the PATTERN was mined from the since-retired search-v2 window's ask client — never
 * imported, because a dev window importing another dev window's module is the coupling this arc
 * exists to avoid):
 *  - `buildRequestBody('core.rag-ask', …)` — the per-shape POST body.
 *  - `consumeShapeStream` + `dispatchShapeEventToHandlers` — the ONE SSE consumer, so the
 *    connection-budget accounting in `streams.ts` stays correct.
 *  - the GENERATED `CoreRagAskHandlers` interface — a new shape event is a compile-time fact.
 *  - `claimsToCitations` (Phase F4) — the ONE claim→mark resolver, so this window's inline `[n]`
 *    marks are the same resolution the shipped surfaces render.
 *  - `friendlyStreamError` (Phase F7) — the ONE stream-error vocabulary.
 *
 * Phase F7 also opened the two channels this shape declares and F1 left unread: `reasoning_chunk`
 * (the model's thinking) and `rag.rewrite` (the standalone question retrieval ran on). Both are
 * handed to the caller rather than interpreted here — the reasoning payload goes to the shared
 * `ReasoningController` verbatim.
 *
 * Registered in `governance/execution-surfaces.v1.json` (`sv3-ask-client`) as an opaque carrier of
 * the `RetrievalCitation` evidence record: it accumulates the backend's citation payloads and hands
 * them to its caller unchanged, deriving nothing from a citation's fields.
 *
 * FOUR TERMINALS, EXACTLY ONE OF THEM, ALWAYS. `sv3Ask` never throws: completion, refusal (the
 * session lock's 423), a halt the reader asked for, and failure are four distinct sink calls, so the
 * caller's turn can always reach a terminal state and can always say WHICH one it reached. A halt is
 * not a failure and must not be worded as one — the reader stopped the answer on purpose.

 * How much work the next question asks for (tempdoc 822 Phase F10; the §4b ADAPTATION RATIFIED —
 * the spec's per-session provider picker maps to an effort control, because there is ONE local
 * model and therefore no provider to pick).
 *
 * Every rung is a REAL request parameter the shared dispatch path already reads. Verified at the
 * source rather than assumed, because a control that changes nothing is the exact failure this
 * window exists to avoid:
 *  - `enableThinking` — `ConversationEngine.java:781-786` turns it into `SamplingParams`, and
 *    `OnlineModeOps.java:611-614` forwards it to llama-server as
 *    `chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": …}`. It is the switch behind the reasoning block
 *    Phase F7 wired (inventory C9).
 *  - `maxTokens` — `ConversationEngine.java:772-778`; absent means the engine's own
 *    `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS = 1024` (`:65`).
 *  - `topK` — `RAGContext.java:421-428`; precedence is body → configured → `DEFAULT_TOP_K = 5`
 *    (`:55`, `:88-94`), so an explicit per-request value always wins.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO reasoning-effort or posture parameter in the table: the backend has
 * none (`buildRequestBody` declares question/prompt/docIds/schema/sessionId/selection and nothing
 * else), and inventing a name the server ignores would be the dead control in disguise.
 *
 * ONE honest side effect, stated where the mapping is made: `parseSamplingParams` returns sampling
 * params ONLY when `enableThinking` is present, and the object it builds pins temperature 0.8 /
 * top_p 0.95 with it (`ConversationEngine.java:780-786`). So the two rungs that name thinking also
 * pin those two, and `standard` — which sends no parameter at all — is the only rung that leaves
 * every sampling decision to the backend. That is why `standard` is the default and sends `{}`
 * rather than a spelled-out copy of the defaults: a rung that restates the backend's numbers would
 * silently fork them the first time they change.
