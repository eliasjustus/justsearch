 * sv3-record — the canonical thread RECORD, projected into this window's turns (tempdoc 822 Phase

 *
 * Derived from a third-party design system (MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * The window is NOT the authority on what happened in a conversation. `GET /api/thread/{id}` is, and
 * the product already owns both halves of reading it: `views/unifiedThreadClient.ts`
 * (`fetchUnifiedThread` — schema, forward-tolerant per-event parsing, the EMPTY-on-failure contract)
 * and `views/unifiedThreadProjection.ts` (`projectUnifiedThread` — authoritative `occurredAt` order,
 * tool-lifecycle merge by `callId`, run segmentation). Both are consumed by the shipped window as
 * well as by this one, which is what makes them shared authorities rather than one window's
 * extraction; this module imports the pair and adds ONLY the last mile — grouping the ordered items
 * into the turns this window renders.
 *
 * It authors no fetch, no schema and no ordering of its own, and it is pure: same items in, same
 * turns out. The record's interleaving is preserved exactly (561 P-A: chat turns and agent activity
 * come from ONE record and must not be re-sorted into two lists), and it is expressed in the SAME
 * `Sv3RunFeedItem` shapes the live controller feed produces — so a settled run and a running one go
 * through one renderer in `Sv3Main`, not two.
