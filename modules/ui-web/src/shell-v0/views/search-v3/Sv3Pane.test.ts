/**
 * Tempdoc 849 slice 3 — `jf-sv3-pane`, the Search v3 window's citation-inspection REGION.
 *
 * The element had no test file at all until this slice, which is why it also carries the
 * `execution-surfaces` register guard for the pane row: a `test:<Name>` guard needs a file to
 * resolve against, and a dangling guard reports green while asserting nothing.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the region's ONE law: it forwards, and it derives nothing. Everything a
 * document needs to be read belongs to the shared `jf-document-pane`, and every fact about the
 * citation is joined in `SearchV3View` from the turn's own evidence record. A label re-authored on
 * the way through this element — a re-worded badge, a re-banded score, a defaulted inclusion state —
 * would be exactly the fork the register exists to prevent, and nothing else in the suite is
 * positioned to see it.
