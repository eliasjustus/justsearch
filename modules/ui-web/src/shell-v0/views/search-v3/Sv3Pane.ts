 * jf-sv3-pane — the Search v3 window's citation-inspection pane (tempdoc 822 Phase F8).
 *
 * Derived from T3 Code (T3 Tools Inc., MIT) — see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md in this directory.
 *
 * A REGION, not a reader. Everything a document needs to be read — the fetch, the rendered/source
 * modes, the provenance header, the close control, and the land-strong-then-settle decay on the cited
 * passage — belongs to the product's ONE reading surface, `components/documentPane/DocumentPane.ts`,
 * which this element mounts by side-effect import (`:112-168`). What is added here is only what the
 * donor's right panel adds around its own reader: the window-anchored frame, the two presentations
 * the donor's 980px switch chooses between, and the boundary the reader can move.
 *
 *  - **No second emphasis.** The pane's `HIGHLIGHT_DECAY_MS` (`DocumentPane.ts:95,145,226-244`) is
 *    already the citation landing — re-render-safe and reduced-motion-aware. A highlight of this
 *    window's own would be a fork of an authority that exists.
 *  - **Cited documents only** (F8 scope guard, standing owner directive: search integration is
 *    deferred indefinitely). `docPath` is `attribute: false` — there is no markup, deeplink or
 *    attribute route into this element, and the window's ONE writer of it is the citation handler in
 *    `SearchV3View`. Opening an arbitrary search result, a browse row or a path the reader types is
 *    the DEFERRED boundary, and it stays outside this element: nothing here takes a path from
 *    anywhere but a citation, and the chrome carries no search affordance.
 *  - **Window-scoped, never document-fixed** (the palette's containment precedent): in the narrow
 *    presentation the backdrop dims THIS WINDOW's box and nothing of the shipped shell's chrome.
 *
 * The shared `pane-close` is stopped here and re-raised as this window's own `sv3-pane-close`, for
 * the same reason the citation event is stopped in `Sv3Main`: a `composed` event from a shared
 * component travels the whole way to the Shell, and this window answers its own regions.
 *
 * Side-effect registers <jf-sv3-pane>.

         WINDOW-SCOPED, not document-fixed — the palette's containment precedent: absolutely
         positioned against the window host's box, so the dim reaches the window region and nothing of
         the shipped shell's rail, topbar or status bar.

         Driven by an ATTRIBUTE the window sets from its own measurement, NOT by a @container query,
         and the reason is recorded rather than worked around: a container query needs
         container-type on an ancestor, the only ancestor here is the window host, and
         container-type implies layout containment — which makes the host a containing block for
         FIXED-position descendants. F7's <jf-citation-hover-card> is exactly that (it is positioned
         from viewport coordinates, components/chat/CitationHoverCard.ts:45), so declaring the
         container would silently re-anchor and mis-place every citation preview in the window. This
         is the trap views/unifiedChatStyles.ts:207-212 already recorded for the same reason. The
         breakpoint therefore lives ONCE, in sv3-boundaries.ts, where the sidebar's clamp reads the
