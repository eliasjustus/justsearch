/**
 * The Search v3 ask path's PRODUCER GATE (tempdoc 847 S2 / §1.5).
 *
 * The window used to merge every `rag.citation_matches` entry as verified provenance without ever
 * reading the payload's `scorer`, so on a scorer-less or scorer-failing install it painted
 * embedding-cosine numbers — whose supported and unsupported bands interleave at a 0.0049 margin
 * (836 §9.7) — with cross-encoder-calibrated grounding tiers.
 *
 * Every gate case runs the SAME fixture through two producers, because the assertion that matters is
 * a DIFFERENCE: a "zero marks" expectation over a fixture that could never mint one passes for the
 * wrong reason (`claimsToCitations` returns `[]` for an empty source list, `citationResolve.ts:32`),
 * so each gated case is paired with the cross-encoder twin that must mark.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network and nothing here mocks the shared stream consumer: the global
 * fetch is stubbed with a Response-shaped stub whose body is a real SSE stream, exactly as
 * `SearchV3View.ask.test.ts` does it, so the frames travel the REAL parser and the REAL event-name →
 * handler dispatch on their way in.
