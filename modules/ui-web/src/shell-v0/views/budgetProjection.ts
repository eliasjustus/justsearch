 *    DISPLAY, because showing a reader a negative remaining is nonsense — but borrowing a display
 *    clamp into arithmetic would under-fund every over-budget gate by exactly the overrun.
 *  - `headroom` is the provider-REPORTED last prompt, not a fraction of `tokensNeeded`.
 *    `tokensNeeded` is the loop's projection, which is schema-blind and measured ~40% low (577);
 *    sizing the safety margin from the biased number would bias the margin the same way.
 *
 * **Monotone separation.** Flooring collapses steps: three arms can land on the same number with
 * three different labels. After flooring, each step is pushed strictly above the previous one by a
 * visible margin. The fine-print token figure is the authority — if two labels would spend the
