/**
 * Lazy loaders for navigable route surfaces.
 *
 * Each of these surface modules has exactly ONE module-scope side effect —
 * `customElements.define('jf-<x>-surface', …)` — and was previously pulled into
 * the eager app entry chunk by a side-effect `import './views/<X>Surface.js'`
 * in `index.ts`. They are only ever *mounted* when the user navigates to them
 * (`chrome/Shell.ts` `renderOneSurface()`), so importing them eagerly is pure
 * cold-start cost: it inflates `app_main` (the ui-bundle byte budget) for code
 * the first paint never touches.
 *
 * Deferring them to a dynamic `import()` keyed by mount tag moves each surface
 * into its own async chunk, loaded on first navigation. A navigated view
 * legitimately shows a brief loading state, so there is no UX regression.
 *
 * NOT lazy (kept eager in `index.ts`): `jf-search-surface` — the default
 * landing view, so first paint never flashes a loader — plus the always-present
 * chrome (`UnifiedChatView`, `Shell`) and shared components.
