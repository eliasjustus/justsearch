 * Indexing-jobs → Task bridge — Tempdoc 543 §32 #1 (additive follow-up).
 *
 * Projects the backend `core.indexing-jobs` TABULAR Resource stream
 * (GET /api/indexing-jobs/stream, SSE) into the Task substrate (§32 R-E1) so
 * live backend indexing work shows in the ambient Task tray alongside agent
 * operations — a glanceable "what's running now" indicator across the app.
 *
 * READ-ONLY by design (the user's chosen scope): job-tasks carry NO cancel
 * affordance. Cancel/retry stay on the `core.indexing-jobs` Resource view
 * (which owns CANCEL_OP / RETRY_OP) — the tray must not duplicate that control
 * surface. The bridge only OBSERVES.
 *
 * Reconcile (STATELESS — the substrate is the source of truth; privacy-safe,
 * raw paths never on the wire, only pathHash):
 *   - job present, state != FAILED → ensure a running Task (id
 *     `idxjob:<pathHash>`); revives a stale terminal task if the same pathHash
 *     re-appears non-FAILED (e.g. an in-place retry).
 *   - job present, state == FAILED → ensure a failed Task.
 *   - job-task in the substrate but ABSENT from the live set → removeTask
 *     (the job finished / was cleared / the stream reset). It VANISHES rather
 *     than being marked 'succeeded' — correct for a "what's running now" tray
 *     (job history lives in the core.indexing-jobs Resource view), and removal
 *     (vs a guarded terminal transition) is what lets a re-appearing job re-add
 *     cleanly instead of being stranded in a terminal status after a reset.
 *
 * Reuses the canonical TABULAR reducer (`subscriptionStrategy.tabularStrategy`)
 * so frame parsing (snapshot / insert / update / delete / snapshot-replaced) is
 * not re-derived; the bridge owns only the items→Task projection.
