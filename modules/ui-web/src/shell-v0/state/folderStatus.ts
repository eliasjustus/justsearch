/**
 * folderStatus.ts — the ONE per-folder indexing-status derivation (tempdoc 599 §9.1).
 *
 * The folder-granularity sibling of `computeVerdict` (595 §4.2): a single pure function that
 * decides a watched folder's truthful state, so every row consumer projects from it instead of
 * re-interpreting raw fields at the render site (the 594/597 single-authority discipline).
 *
 * THE TRUTHFULNESS FIX: `ready` derives from job DRAIN (`inFlight === 0 && failed === 0`), never
 * from the walk-completion timestamp. The wire `status` field is walk-derived and means "scanned",
 * NOT "searchable" — so a folder showing "✓ indexed" while its jobs are still processing (the
 * §8.1 false-positive) is unrepresentable here: a non-empty `inFlightCount` forces `indexing`.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-light: takes the already-formatted relative time and the system `provisional`
 * flag (the caller's projection of the `Stability` axis, mirroring `renderObserved`), so the seam
 * needs no host-utility or store import and is trivially unit-testable.
 *
 * TWO TIERS (tempdoc 813 §4 + 809 finding 1, superseding the 599 §10 / 598 note that used to sit
 * here): job drain makes a folder KEYWORD-searchable, which is not the same fact as "fully
 * searchable" — the semantic layers are a separate backfill that carries no per-root job rows, and
 * the DOC-level counters read fully healthy during a PASSAGE-level backfill (809 finding 9's trap;
 * `enrichmentCoverage.ts` documents it). Since 813 the wire row also carries per-root enrichment
 * COVERAGE, so the drained tier splits: `enriching` while coverage is still climbing (the shared
 * `ENRICHMENT_CATCHING_UP_CAVEAT` wording, plus this root's own percent when derivable) and `ready`
 * once it is complete ("fully searchable"). When per-root coverage is not derivable the index-wide
 * positive-evidence boolean (`enrichmentProgress(status).pending`) is the fallback gate — caveat
 * without a percent, never a fabricated number. Neither tier derives from the walk timestamp.
