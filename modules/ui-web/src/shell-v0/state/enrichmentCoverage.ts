/**
 * enrichmentCoverage.ts — the ONE answer to "is enrichment still catching up?" (809 finding 1).
 *
 * THE DEFECT IT EXISTS FOR: text extraction and the Lucene write finish fast; embedding, SPLADE and
 * NER run AFTERWARDS on a separate backfill scheduler. During that window keyword search works and
 * semantic/hybrid search does not — yet the Library row already showed the terminal "✓ indexed",
 * claiming a capability the system does not have yet. The completion claim has to consult coverage,
 * not just job-queue drain. Wiring, not backend: every counter below is already on `/api/status`.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS DERIVATION EXISTS TO AVOID (809 finding 9): the DOC-level counters read fully healthy
 * during an active PASSAGE-level backfill — measured live, `/api/knowledge/status` reported
 * `embeddingCoveragePercent: 100.0`, `queueDepth: 0`, `pendingJobsCount: 0` while
 * `chunkEmbeddingPendingCount` was 1554 and `chunkVectorsReady` was false. A gate reading only the
 * doc-level counter is the wrong-gate mistake with a green light on it, so this reads BOTH levels.
 *
 * POSITIVE EVIDENCE ONLY — the same doctrine `availability.indexingInFlight` follows. A tier counts as
 * catching up when its own PENDING counter is > 0 and the tier is not disabled. Absent/undefined
 * fields are UNKNOWN, never "pending": we do not attach a caveat we cannot witness. And it keys on
 * PENDING WORK, never on a `ready`/coverage flag alone — a tier that is not ready with nothing pending
 * is a stalled/failed condition (Health's subject), not "still computing", and gating the row on it
 * would pin a permanent caveat that never clears.
 *
 * SCOPE HONESTY: these counters are INDEX-WIDE. The backfill batches documents without recording which
 * root they came from (809 finding 2), so "this folder is 40% enriched" is not derivable today. A
 * consumer may therefore say only that enrichment is in flight, never that it is in flight *for this
 * folder* — which is why the caveat below names the capability, not a per-folder percentage.
 *
 * Pure data → data; no DOM, no IO, no store import.
