/**
 * Tempdoc 914 D3 — the "N failed" chip must stay REACHABLE while the retry ladder re-queues a
 * permanently failing file.
 *
 * Measured on the live stack (2 files failing with `ExtractionException: Sandbox parser failed`,
 * nothing else pending), 60 samples of `/api/indexing-roots/substrate` at 300ms:
 *
 *   inFlight=0 failed=2  x56      the settled truth
 *   inFlight=2 failed=0  x4       the retry window — the re-queued jobs count as IN-FLIGHT
 *
 * A re-queued FAILED job is PENDING while it waits, so the worker's per-root `GROUP BY` reports it
 * as in-flight and not as failed; the wire carries nothing that distinguishes it from a first
 * attempt. In those windows the seam took its `inFlight > 0` branch, `failed` fell to 0, the chip
 * disappeared and the drill-down was unreachable — on a folder whose files will NEVER succeed, so
 * the flicker is permanent, not transitional.
 *
 * The three sampled states are pinned below, plus the two directions the rule must NOT go: it may
 * never invent a count the substrate never reported, and a settled zero must discharge the memory.
 *
 * Review finding S2-1 added the third describe block: the carry has to live ABOVE the branch chain,
 * because `provisional` / `unavailable` / `walkError` all outrank the in-flight branch this file
 * originally covered on its own.

 * The first cut carried the count inside `inFlight > 0` only. `provisional`, `unavailable` and
 * `walkError` all return earlier and all returned the RAW `failed`, so a retry window coinciding
 * with any of them still dropped the chip. Measured on the served FE: the shell was provisional for
 * 168 of 250 renders, so the majority path was the unfixed one and the fix engaged 0 times in 250.
 *
 * Each case below is the same wire sample — `failed=0, inFlight=2`, the retry window — differing
 * only in which branch claims it.
