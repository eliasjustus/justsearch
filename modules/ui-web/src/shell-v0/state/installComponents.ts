/**
 * installComponents.ts — tempdoc 840 Phase 5: the ONE derivation behind the user-facing side of the
 * AI model install.
 *
 * Before this module the install was a single undifferentiated ~7 GB wait: a percentage, a byte
 * counter, no rate, no ETA, and nothing naming what any of it was for. The backend has known far
 * more than that since Phases 0-4 — a standing per-component list on
 * `GET /api/ai/install/plan-preview` (`components[]`), an ordered stage plan with per-stage
 * capabilities on `GET /api/ai/install/status` (`stages[]` / `readyCapabilities`), and a measured
 * transfer rate + horizon. This module projects those wire facts into the shapes three surfaces
 * render (the Brain panel, the System Self-View, the task tray) so the SAME fact is never derived
 * twice with two different answers.
 *
 * Two properties are load-bearing and are why the composition lives here rather than inline in a
 * template:
 *
 *  1. **`-1` is UNKNOWN, and an unknown segment is OMITTED.** `AiInstallStatus.bytesPerSecond` /
 *     `remainingSeconds` carry `-1` as an explicit sentinel and never `0` (see the field javadoc:
 *     "a fabricated `0 B/s` on a transfer that is merely young is the most confident lie the surface
 *     could tell"). {@link composeTransferLine} therefore builds its line the way `TaskList`'s
 *     counts-line does — every segment past the first is APPENDED and each is withdrawn ENTIRELY
 *     when there is no honest basis for it — reusing `humanizeSeconds`, the one duration formatter,
 *     rather than adding a second.
 *
 *  2. **`unavailable` is not `declined`.** Hardware this machine lacks is not a choice the user
 *     made, so it gets the typed `unavailable{reason}` availability and NO control, while a
 *     declinable component gets a real opt-OUT control. Rendering the two the same way would imply
 *     an option that does not exist.
