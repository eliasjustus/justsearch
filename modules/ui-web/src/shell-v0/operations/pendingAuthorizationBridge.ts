 * pendingAuthorizationBridge — tempdoc 655.
 *
 * Surfaces a backend-created {@code PendingAuthorization} in the running app even when the
 * frontend never made the request that triggered the gate — concretely, an MCP tool call from
 * an external AI agent. Today's `authorizationBroker` ceremony is otherwise strictly
 * request-scoped: a gated `fetch` gets a 428 with a `pendingId` in THAT SAME response, and
 * `OperationClient.invokeWithConsent` hands it to the broker. An MCP-originated gate has no such
 * in-flight request for the frontend to observe.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors `api/intent/bootIntentStreamBridge.ts` (tempdoc 662's multiplexed-stream
 * subscriber shape) and `substrates/tasks/indexingJobsBridge.ts`'s `startXBridge(apiBase, opts)`
 * boot signature — subscribes the `system:pending-authorizations` streamId (event-only, no
 * snapshot lifecycle — each creation is its own self-contained announcement, same as the intent
 * stream) on the shared `MultiplexedStream`.
 *
 * On each announcement, this reuses the EXISTING ceremony (`authorizationBroker.requestAuthorization`
 * — the same `<jf-authorization-host>` dialog a live REST 428 already uses) rather than a new
 * presentation surface. Two genuinely new steps, both tempdoc 655 fix-pass additions:
 *
 * 1. The broadcast itself deliberately carries NO decision content (no args summary, no
 *    rationale) — only routing info (id, operation id, tiers). Putting that content on a channel
 *    every local subscriber receives would violate the existing privacy posture that scopes it
 *    to the point-to-point 428 response (tempdoc 444b / 550 F3 — see `PendingAuthorizationEvent`'s
 *    doc comment). So this bridge fetches the content itself, by id, via
 *    `OperationClient.peekPending` — the two-step shape mirrors what the REST 428 path gets in
 *    one response, just split into "learn it exists" (broadcast) then "learn what it is" (fetch).
 * 2. Because the frontend never held this pending's original arguments (it wasn't the caller),
 *    approval can't complete by the browser re-`invoke`-ing with a capsule the way
 *    `OperationClient.invokeWithConsent` does for its own gated calls. Instead it calls
 *    `OperationClient.approveAndExecutePending`, which asks the backend to complete the dispatch
 *    itself, server-side, using the pending's own stored args — the design tempdoc 655 settled on
 *    specifically so the MCP tool call never has to block or be retried by the calling agent.
