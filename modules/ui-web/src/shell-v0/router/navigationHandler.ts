/**
 * NavigationHandler — Intent substrate tier 3 (slice 492).
 *
 * Given a {@link ShellAddressNavigation}, bring observable reality into
 * alignment: distribute state to registered StoreAdapters per the surface's
 * stateSchema, set the active surface, push the URL, and activate the
 * projector. This is the canonical "realize a Navigation intent" site —
 * the body that previously lived as a side-effect of URLHydrator.applyState
 * and as Shell.activateSurface's ignored `state` parameter.
 *
 * Invariants (slice 492):
 *
 *   - **Determinism per address.** Two handle() calls with the same
 *     `ShellAddressNavigation` converge the observable state to the same
 *     final shape: store contents are equal; activeId equals the target;
 *     the URL hash reflects the canonical projection. Note this is
 *     weaker than CQRS-style "idempotency at the effect level":
 *     `pushState` is called once per handle() with `push: true`, so
 *     two handles produce two history entries — both pointing at the
 *     same canonical URL. Callers that want effect-level idempotency
 *     pass `push: false` (the popstate path uses this).
 *   - **Bidirectionality** (redux-first-router precedent). Every handler
 *     write round-trips to the URL via the projector. Guaranteed because
 *     activateProjection subscribes to every store the schema names.
 *   - **Transport purity** (hexagonal precedent). The handler takes a
 *     parsed ShellAddress, never a raw Location or SSE wrapper.
 *
 * Concurrency policy (slice 492 — last-writer-wins by synchronous
 * execution): handle() steps are synchronous (validate → distribute
 * → activate → push → project). JavaScript's single-threaded event
 * loop serializes them; two overlapping handle() calls run in
 * call-order, and the second's effects land on top of the first's.
 * Combined with the determinism property below, this produces the
 * correct user-intent ordering for rapid overlaps (rail-click then
 * popstate then URL paste).
 *
 * A previous draft installed an AbortController + per-step `signal.aborted`
 * checks intending "cancel-in-flight"; that machinery cannot abort
 * anything when steps are synchronous (no event-loop yield between
 * checks) and was removed in the slice-492 critical-analysis follow-up.
 * If a future step becomes async (e.g., per-surface preflight fetch),
 * an AbortController can be re-introduced WITH an `await signal.aborted`
 * checkpoint that actually does something.
