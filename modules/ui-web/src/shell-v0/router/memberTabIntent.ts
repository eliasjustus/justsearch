 * memberTabIntent — tempdoc 571 §11 / 578: the "open this member's tab" signal (pub/sub + one-shot).
 *
 * When a member deep-link (e.g. core.browse-surface) is redirected to its host (core.library-surface),
 * the host's `<jf-surface-tabs>` should open the requested member's tab rather than the default first
 * tab. The mounted host element does not receive the redirect's `originalId` directly, so this module
 * is the narrow hand-off. It serves BOTH mount timings:
 *
 *   - **host not yet mounted** (navigating from elsewhere): the request is stored as a one-shot
 *     `pending[hostId]` that the host drains in `connectedCallback` (`takeMemberTabIntent`).
 *   - **host already mounted** (you're on the host and follow a member deep-link → the redirect lands
 *     on the already-active host, so no re-mount fires): subscribers are notified synchronously, and
 *     the live host switches its tab (`subscribeMemberTab`). This is the post-review fix for the
 *     "already-active host doesn't switch tabs" bug.
 *
 * The publish (`requestMemberTab`) is called from the navigation-apply step (the intentRouter redirect
 * hook wired in Shell), NOT from the surface resolver — keeping `resolveSurface` pure (no stale intent
 * from a speculative resolution).

 * already-mounted host switches its tab via the listener and leaves no `pending` that a later
 * navigate-away-and-back would wrongly drain.
