/**
 * URLProjector — slice 489 §6 source-of-truth projection.
 *
 * State is the source of truth; the URL is a projection. The projector
 * subscribes to every store referenced by the active surface's
 * {@code SurfaceStateSchema.bindings} and writes the canonical URL to the
 * browser bar via {@code history.replaceState} when any of them publishes.
 *
 * Per slice 489 §10: the router never sets state; it only reads. The
 * Shell.activateSurface(...) caller is responsible for writing state before
 * activating; the projector then mirrors the resulting state onto the URL.
 *
 * Push vs replace semantics:
 *   - `replaceState` (default): used for incremental edits within a surface
 *     (typing in the search box) — the URL bar tracks the live state without
 *     bloating browser history.
 *   - `pushState`: used when the active surface changes (rail click, palette,
 *     deep-link). The Shell calls `pushAddress(...)` directly at activation
 *     time; the projector's subsequent state-driven writes use replaceState.
 *   - `pushState` again, tempdoc 864 PR C: an IN-SURFACE state change the
 *     emitting store declares to be a navigation — see
 *     {@link projectAsNavigation}. A surface can replace everything the reader
 *     is looking at without changing surface, and slice 489's two-case split
 *     had no room for that.

 * during fast typing). The projection model still demands eventual
 * consistency between state and URL — debouncing is the trailing-edge
 * collapse, not a semantic change.

 * the URL feel stale on a normal-cadence typist (the trailing write lands

 * replaces the entire transcript when the reader claims another conversation; under replace-only
 * projection that swap left no history entry, so Back did nothing and an accidental one was
 * recoverable only by reload (§2.7a — the incident this PR closes).
 *
 * The distinction is per-CHANGE, not per-surface and not per-store: the same store write is a
 * navigation when the reader opened something and a rehydration when the URL, a popstate or a
 * reload pointer replayed it. Only the emitting store knows which, so it says so by wrapping the
 * emission in {@link projectAsNavigation}. Everything that does not wrap keeps slice 489's
