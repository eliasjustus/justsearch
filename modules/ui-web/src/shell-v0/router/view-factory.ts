/**
 * Slice 491 §9.D Phase E (C0) — typed view-factory brand for ConversationShape mounts.
 *
 * Mirrors the slice 478 §4.A SurfaceFactory pattern (`api/registry/SurfaceCatalogClient.ts`)
 * verbatim, with the shape ref as the type parameter:
 *
 * 1. **Type-level brand** — the `__viewBrand: symbol` field prevents accidental
 *    constructions like `{mount: () => el}` from satisfying the ViewFactory type.
 *    Consumers can READ the symbol off a real factory but the type system rejects
 *    objects without the field.
 *
 * 2. **Runtime brand verification** — `mountView()` checks WeakSet membership.
 *    The WeakSet is module-private; a consumer with only a factory reference
 *    cannot insert into it. So stealing `__viewBrand` from a real factory and
 *    forging `{__viewBrand: stolen, mount: () => evilEl}` passes the type check
 *    (Symbol matches) but FAILS the runtime verification (forged factory not in WeakSet).
 *
 * The factory's mount() returns an HTMLElement that the chrome can append to a
 * shape-mount slot. Per §9.E A2: SurfaceFactory's brand pattern transplants here
 * verbatim; HMR survival is a single-test residual check during C0 dev work.
