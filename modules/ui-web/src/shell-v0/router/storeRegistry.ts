 * Store registry — slice 489 §5 / §6 source-of-truth wiring.
 *
 * Maps the abstract {@code storeId} declared in `SurfaceStateSchema.bindings`
 * to a concrete FE store's serialize/restore API. The registry is the only
 * indirection layer between the router and the existing pub-sub stores —
 * the router never imports store modules directly. Adding a new store-as-
 * surface-state-source is one registration, not a router refactor.
 *
 * Each store implementation provides:
 *   - `serialize()` — returns a plain bag matching the schema field types
 *   - `restore(snapshot)` — applies the bag (silently coerces by type)
 *   - `subscribe(callback)` — pub-sub for the URL projector to listen on
 *
 * Per slice 489 §6: state is the source of truth, URL is the projection.
 * The router calls `restore` on URL arrival and `subscribe` to drive
 * `replaceState` on store changes.

   *
   * It is wrong for a store whose whole content IS the address. Search v3's hero — no conversation
   * claimed — projects as the bare surface address, so the entry a new session pushes carries no
   * `conversationId`. Under the default skip, going FORWARD onto that entry would leave the window
   * showing the conversation the reader had just left, with a URL saying otherwise.
   *
   * Gated on traversal deliberately: a programmatic `activateSurface(id, {})` also arrives with no
   * state, and treating that as "close the open conversation" would make a re-navigation to this
   * surface destructive. A traversal is the one arrival where the browser has already moved and the
   * address is therefore the authority.
