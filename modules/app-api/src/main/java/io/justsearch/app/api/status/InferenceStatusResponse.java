/**
 * Response for {@code GET /api/inference/status}.
 *
 * <p>Tempdoc 663 §L/Stage 4 — replaces the hand-built {@code Map<String,Object>} previously
 * assembled in {@code InferenceHandlers.handleInferenceStatus}. Every field below existed on the
 * wire before this record was introduced; none were added or dropped, only typed. {@code mode}
 * stays a plain {@code String} (not the {@code Mode} enum) — {@code OnlineAiService.getCurrentMode()}
 * is itself declared to return {@code String} (its own concrete implementations compute the wire
 * value directly), so enforcing the mode *value* set at compile time would mean changing that
 * interface's contract, a larger and separately-scoped change; this record's contribution is the
 * JSON *shape* (field names/types) becoming schema-generated and cross-language-fixture-checked,
 * closing the "hand-built endpoint feeding a hand-typed FE field, no schema between them" gap the
 * design named — not a mode-value compile-time guarantee.
 *
 * <p>Stability: stable (API contract) — {@code HttpModeTransitionTest} asserts on
 * {@code mode}/{@code available}/{@code starting}; {@code docs/reference/api-contract-map.md}
 * documents this endpoint.
