/**
 * Orthogonal-to-{@link ExecutorTag} discriminator naming the transport an invocation or
 * unprompted emission arrived through.
 *
 * <p>Per slice 490 §4.B (substrate factoring) — promoted from slice 489 §8's proposal of a
 * cross-cutting transport axis. {@code ExecutorTag} answers <em>who</em> is executing
 * ({@code UI} / {@code AGENT} / {@code CLI}); {@code TransportTag} answers <em>how the
 * invocation arrived</em>. The two axes do not co-vary — e.g., a URL-bar paste and a rail
 * click are both {@code UI} executor but distinguishable by transport
 * ({@code URL_BAR} vs {@code BUTTON}).
 *
 * <p>Per slice 489 §13 anti-pattern #4 ("do not gate on {@code TransportTag} inside
 * {@link ConfirmStrategy}"): transport-specific overlays are a separate primitive
 * (resolver decoration), not a flag on the canonical execution gate. {@code TransportTag}
 * is descriptive, not prescriptive.
 *
 * <p>Values reflect the union of consumer needs across slices 487 (LLM-emitter consumer
 * cluster), 489 (URL-substrate consumer cluster), 490 (proactive-emission consumer
 * cluster), and 491 (chat-substrate stream consumer). New transports add by appending an
 * enum value without forking {@code ExecutorTag}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Forward-compat scaffolding</strong> (Pass-8 follow-up note). v1 has live
 * producers for only {@link #BUTTON} (HTTP {@code /api/operations/{id}/invoke}) and
 * {@link #SYSTEM_INTERNAL} (the legacy 2-arg dispatch default). The remaining values
 * ({@code URL_BAR}, {@code URL_DEEPLINK}, {@code LLM_EMISSION}, {@code PALETTE},
 * {@code RAIL}, {@code AGENT_LOOP}, {@code MCP}, {@code PLUGIN_EMITTED},
 * {@code SCHEDULED}, {@code RULE_ENGINE}) are anticipated by the {@code
 * OperationExecutorImpl.validateProvenance} whitelist + by slices 487 / 489 / 491 but
 * have no producer in this branch yet. They are kept ahead of the producers so the
 * validator's contract is stable across consumer-cluster rollout; the alternative
 * (extending the enum + the validator with every new producer) is the wrong shape.
