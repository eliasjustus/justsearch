 * SPI: subscribes to LLM model output events; may emit SSE events, execute side effects, and
 * report message-list deltas for the next iteration.
 *
 * <p>Per tempdoc 491 §5.1 (data-flow audit): one of the four substrate SPIs. The contract
 * supports three things — emit typed SSE events, execute side effects (operation dispatch,
 * approval gates, URL navigation), and return message deltas the next iteration must see.
 * The "read-only consumer" framing was wrong; consumers may mutate the next iteration's
 * input.
 *
 * <p>Prior-art examples: the agent loop's tool-call parser (parses tool-call grammar,
 * dispatches via {@code OperationDispatcher}, runs approval gates, appends tool-result
 * messages) and the RAG-handler's citation matcher (post-hoc matches retrieved chunks to
 * generated text, emits {@code rag.citation_matches} events). The {@link StreamConsumer}
 * contract is designed forward to support both mid-stream and post-stream consumers.
 *
 * <p>Example consumers (not exhaustive): {@code ToolCallExecutor} (mid-stream parser, internal
 * to the {@code ToolIterating} shape), {@code URLExtractor} (post-{@code onDone} URL parsing
 * for the URL-emission shape), {@code CitationMatcher} (post-{@code onDone} citation matching
 * for the RAG ask shape).
 *
 * <p><strong>Phase B status</strong>: the SPI interface is defined; the only consumer
 * registered in Phase B is the tool-call executor inside the agent loop's encapsulated body.
 * Fresh consumers land in Phase C with the RAG ask and URL emission shape migrations.
