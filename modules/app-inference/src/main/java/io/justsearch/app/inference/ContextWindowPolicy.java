/**
 * Derives the llama-server context window ({@code -c}) instead of reading it as a user preference.
 *
 * <p>Tempdoc 883 decision 1. The model ships with a 262k training context and the app used to run
 * it at 4096, because that was the shipped value of a settings field nobody could see. This policy
 * replaces the number with a <b>ladder of explicit {@code -c} values, stepped down on launch
 * failure</b>.
 *
 * <p>No VRAM arithmetic and no GGUF reader, deliberately (tempdoc 883 fold <b>[R3]</b>): the
 * packaged model is a Gated-Delta-Net hybrid whose KV footprint no dense-attention formula predicts
 * within 4x, {@code /props} on the bundled b8571 build does not expose {@code n_ctx_train}, and an
 * over-large {@code -c} is a fast hard abort — so trying a rung is both cheaper and more truthful
 * than estimating one. Free VRAM is recorded for diagnosis, never used as an input.
 *
 * <p><b>The top rung is a BUDGET, not a fit.</b> Measured 2026-09-02 on the 12 GB dev card, the
 * packaged 9B loads at its full 262144 training context with two slots (KV 4352 MiB, 10.3 GB
 * total) — so the ladder is deliberately leaving capacity on the table, and llama-server's
 * {@code "the full capacity of the model will not be utilized"} line at 32768 is EXPECTED, not a
 * warning to act on. The rung is capped because (a) prefill latency per RAG ask scales with the
 * prompt and the budget fractions will fill whatever window exists, so the rung is what bounds
 * worst-case latency; (b) KV is reserved up front for the whole {@code n_ctx} whether used or not,
 * and the same card must also hold the embedding / SPLADE / NER encoders, the reranker and VDU
 * batches — 544 MiB at 32k versus ~2.2 GB at 128k is headroom this app chooses to keep; and (c)
 * the ladder's job is stepping DOWN on smaller cards, not maximizing on big ones. A user who wants
 * more sets {@code contextLength} / {@code JUSTSEARCH_CONTEXT_SIZE}, which has no upper clamp.
 *
 * <p>Rungs above the top are skipped.
 *
 * <p>An explicit operator value ({@code justsearch.context.size} resolved above
 * {@code ORDINAL_AUTO_DETECT}) produces a <b>one-rung ladder</b>: it is honoured or the launch
 * fails loud. Silently serving a smaller window than an operator asked for would be the same
 * precedence lie this lane deletes elsewhere.
