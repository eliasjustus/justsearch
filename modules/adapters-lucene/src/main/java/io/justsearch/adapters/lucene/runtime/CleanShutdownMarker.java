/**
 * Durable "the index was closed cleanly" marker (tempdoc 628 Gap 1).
 *
 * <p>The bounded {@code STRUCTURAL} integrity check (commit + segment-info checksums) is cheap enough to
 * run on every open and catches the corruption a crash mid-commit usually produces. But silent
 * <em>body</em> bit-rot in a committed data file is only caught by the {@code FULL} check, which is
 * O(index size) and therefore too slow to run on every clean restart. This marker lets the worker run
 * the heavy {@code FULL} scan <em>only after a crash</em>: the writable runtime drops the marker on a
 * graceful close (after the final commit), and the next open consumes it — an <em>absent</em> marker
 * means the previous shutdown was unclean (a crash) or this is a first run, so a thorough scan is
 * warranted.
 *
 * <p>{@code write.lock} cannot serve this role: Lucene's {@code NativeFSLockFactory} keeps the lock
 * <em>file</em> after a clean close too, so its presence does not distinguish clean from crash. Like
 * {@link IndexRecoveryMarker} this is a <em>sibling</em> file of the index directory, so it never
 * disturbs Lucene's own file set.
