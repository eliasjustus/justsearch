      //     has, and a live replay aid for a mid-run re-attach; neither says anything about the turn.
      //   * `chunk` — the answer text arriving in pieces. `done.finalResponse` persists the whole of
      //     it, which is why the record path rebuilds the message from the terminal, not the stream.
      //   * `tool_batch_proposed`, `tool_call_approved`, `tool_call_rejected`'s sibling
      //     `tool_call_virtual`, `handoff_proposed`, `directive_acknowledged` — a PROPOSAL or an
      //     acknowledgement whose OUTCOME is already durable: the executed call, the rejection, the
      //     executed handoff, and the steps the directive changed all persist above.
      //   * `budget_update`, `budget_gate`, `context_gate`, `context_compacted` — live meters and
      //     open questions. Every way one of them RESOLVES into a fact the reader must keep is
      //     already a durable `progress` note (`DURABLE_PROGRESS_PHASES`) or the terminal
      //     `disposition` — the 859 §D split this block must not silently re-litigate.
      //   * `intent.resolution` — not an `AgentEvent` variant at all, but the composed
      //     `core.url-extractor` StreamConsumer's own namespaced event. Its payload is still typed
      //     as name-only (`EventDescriptor.nameOnly`), so there is no declared shape to project;
      //     naming it here records that as an open question rather than an answer nobody gave.

  /**
   * Tempdoc 848 §2.4 — project a whole run's persisted events, folding its {@code reasoning_chunk}
   * records into {@code {text, durationMs}} blocks that attach to the turn they belong to.
   *
   * <p>A read-time fold rather than a new durable event type: the journal ALREADY holds every chunk
   * (`AgentRunStore.appendEvent` journals all of them), so a second durable representation would be
   * the fork shape the surface registers exist to prevent.
   *
   * <p>Block boundaries key on the LLM STEP, not on bare contiguity. {@code "chunk"} (the journal
   * name for {@code AgentEvent.TextChunk}) is TRANSPARENT: reasoning runs separated only by text
   * coalesce into ONE block, with the intervening text excluded. This matters because reasoning and
   * text share one stream — on a think-tag-leaking build {@code ThinkTagStreamFilter} reroutes inline
   * {@code <think>} markup into the reasoning sink mid-stream, so naive contiguity would shatter one
   * step into several blocks on one build family and not the other, for identical model behaviour.
   * Every other event type ({@code tool_*}, {@code node_*}, {@code done}, {@code error}…) is a
   * genuine step boundary and cuts the block.
   *
   * <p>{@code durationMs} carries the SAME semantic as the answer plane and the live controller:
   * from the block's first reasoning token to the first non-reasoning output that follows it.
   *
   * <p>Tempdoc 859 §A §1.3 — a cut block is held in {@code pending} and flushed onto the NEXT event
   * that actually projects, whatever kind it is: the tool row, the handoff, the answer. It is NOT
   * attached to the event that cut it, because most cutting events are invisible downstream — a
   * projection must name a carrier that exists in the PROJECTED stream, not one that exists in the
   * source journal. Nor is it retargeted onto the next {@code ASSISTANT_MESSAGE}, the rule this
   * replaces: on an agent run the only assistant message is the terminal {@code done}, so every
   * block in a multi-step run landed on it and the reader got a wall of thoughts detached from the
   * steps that produced them.
   *
   * <p>Blocks left unflushed at the end of the walk attach to the run's terminal event (its
   * {@code ERROR} if it produced one, else its last event): what the model thought before a run was
   * halted or failed was really produced, and the ask WINDOW records exactly that at all four of its
   * terminals. Scope limit (848 §2.4): the ask plane's SERVER side does not — a failed
   * {@code streamLlm} throws before any assistant record is written, so its reasoning survives only
   * in-session. Closing that would mean persisting a partial assistant turn on error, which is a
   * turn-semantics change beyond this charter.
