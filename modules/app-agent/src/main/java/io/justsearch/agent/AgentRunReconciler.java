/**
 * Tempdoc 834 §5.2 — stamps runs the previous process left mid-flight.
 *
 * <p>The gap: {@code AgentRunStore.startRun} writes {@code resumable: true} and
 * {@code updateCheckpoint} recomputes it from state, but NOTHING notices that the owning process is
 * gone. {@link LifecycleState}'s javadoc claims "no orphan-RUNNING hazard" — true within a process,
 * false across a restart. So a run killed by an app close still reads as live, forever.
 *
 * <p>This pass answers only the question "was this run still going when the process died?" and
 * records the answer in ONE additive field. It does not touch {@code state} (the resume seed) or
 * {@code resumable} — see {@link AgentRunStore#markInterrupted}.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent and re-runnable</b>, which is what lets it run at BOTH boot and key-unlock. With
 * at-rest encryption on and the store locked, {@code readMeta} returns null and {@code listSessions}
 * yields nothing, so a boot-only pass would be a silent no-op on exactly the encrypted installs —
 * the reason the unlock seam exists (834 R5).
