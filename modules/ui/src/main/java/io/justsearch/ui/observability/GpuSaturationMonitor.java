/**
 * Tempdoc 419 C3 V2 P3 — head-side rolling-window GPU saturation detector.
 *
 * <p>Mirrors {@code OperationalMetrics.ThroughputMonitor} (worker-core) — same constants and
 * shape — but classifies "GPU pinned high while no workload is active" as SATURATED. The
 * activity gate is the inverse of throughput's: throughput fires STALLED when work is queued
 * but rate is low; saturation fires when nothing is queued but GPU is busy anyway (idle leak,
 * stuck inference session, lingering background job).
 *
 * <p>Thread-safe: all methods are {@code synchronized}. The same instance receives samples from
 * a scheduled sampler and reads from {@code StatusLifecycleHandler} on every {@code /api/status}
 * call; contention is bounded (sampler runs every 15s, status polls at most every few seconds).
