/**
 * Dead-config scanner — tempdoc 799 §O.3 / §N.2.f.1.
 *
 * Answers the question the count ratchet cannot: **does anything actually READ this setting?**
 *
 * Why this exists. Tempdoc 754 found 28 knobs that resolved, were documented, and were read by
 * nothing because a live consumer hardcoded the value — "a false promise to users". 799 removed 22
 * of them and added the count ratchet, and then demonstrated the gap in the most direct way
 * available: four keys survived that cleanup with their `EnvRegistry` declarations and YAML
 * contributions intact, the full unit suite was green, `build -x test` was green, and the count
 * ratchet was green — because a key that resolves but is never read is invisible to all of them.
 * Only inspecting the running backend's own config surface exposed it (799 §N.2.f.1).
 *
 * A setting is considered READ if ANY of three paths reaches it. All three are real and in use, and
 * a scanner that knows only the first would fire ~30 false positives on this repo — which is how a
 * gate gets switched off (799 §O.1's failure mode) rather than obeyed:
 *
 *   1. it is resolved into a {@code ResolvedConfig} record component that some production file
 *      calls the accessor for;
 *   2. it is read directly through its {@code EnvRegistry} enum constant
 *      ({@code EnvRegistry.SOME_KEY.getString(...)});
 *   3. its raw key string appears anywhere in production sources outside the configuration module.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a whole-program analysis: it is a string-level scan. Reflection or a computed
 * key name would be a false positive; none exist in this repo today, and the baseline absorbs any
 * that appear.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION — bare-name collision can MASK a dead component (tempdoc 799 §Q). The
 * `unreadComponents` half matches a bare `.name(`, so an unrelated call on a different type counts
 * as a read. Live instance: `ResolvedConfig.llm()` is never called in production (the only
 * non-declaration `.llm()` is `LlmSettingsV2.llm()` at SettingsController.java:200, a different
 * type), so the ENTIRE `Llm` record is unreachable — yet only `simulatedLatencyMs`, the one
 * uniquely-named component, is reported. Roughly ten documented settings behind that record are
 * therefore false promises this scanner does not catch, including `JUSTSEARCH_LLM_MIN_P` and
 * `JUSTSEARCH_LLM_RNG_SEED` (environment-variables.md:102-103).
 *
 * Two disambiguating heuristics were tried and REJECTED, both falsified against real code:
 * requiring the chained `.parent().component()` form (defeated — `hybridSearch()` is consumed only
 * via assignment), and requiring the containing file to mention `ResolvedConfig` (defeated —
 * SettingsController mentions it incidentally). Precision here needs type information a string
 * scan does not have. An honest limitation beats a heuristic that misfires: a gate that cries wolf
 * gets switched off, which is the §O.1 failure mode this whole tempdoc is about.
 *
 * So: this scanner catches the dead-KEY class reliably and the dead-COMPONENT class only when the
 * name is unique. Do not read a green result as "the config surface is clean".
