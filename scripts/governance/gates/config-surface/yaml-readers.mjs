/**
 * YAML-reader scanner — tempdoc 883 decision 5 (lane A, PR 3).
 *
 * The sibling {@link ./dead-config.mjs} answers "is this DECLARED setting read by anything?".
 * It cannot answer the mirror question, because it never looks at the YAML file at all: its
 * `declared` set is built from `EnvRegistry` constants plus the FIRST argument of every
 * `putYaml*` call. A key that exists in `config/application.yaml` and is contributed by nothing
 * is therefore invisible to it — the file is shipped, the operator edits it, and the value goes
 * nowhere.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Tempdoc 882 (lane 0) found `search.pipeline.profile` and
 * `index.pipeline.profile` sitting in the shipped YAML while the resolver only ever resolves the
 * sysprop spelling `justsearch.search.pipeline.profile` (`ResolvedConfigBuilder.java:1403`,
 * `EnvRegistry.java:258`). Editing the YAML did nothing, silently. Nothing in `scripts/` parsed
 * `application.yaml` before this file, so no check could have caught it.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A READER. `putYaml*(key, root, yamlPath)` takes the YAML path as its THIRD
 * argument and the resolver key as its first; they are usually but not always the same string.
 * Some groups are also walked by hand (`root.path("index").path("ocr").path("languages")`).
 * A YAML key is considered read when any of these holds — for the key itself OR for any ancestor
 * prefix of it, because reading a parent node reads everything under it:
 *
 *   1. its dotted path appears as a string literal in `ResolvedConfigBuilder.java`
 *      (covers both the `putYaml*` yamlPath argument and the resolver-key argument);
 *   2. its segments appear as a `.path("a").path("b")` chain in `ResolvedConfigBuilder.java`
 *      (covers the hand-walked groups);
 *   3. its dotted path appears as a string literal anywhere in production Java outside the three
 *      configuration DECLARATION files — the same "path 3" the dead-config scanner uses, for the
 *      same reason: a consumer may name the key directly.
 *
 * Deliberately a string-level scan, like its sibling. A computed YAML path would be a false
 * positive; none exist today, and the baseline absorbs any that appear.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT — the ancestor rule is deliberately generous. `root.path("search")` marks every
 * key under `search:` as read, which is right for a hand-walked group and wrong for a parent that
 * is walked for one child only. Precision here needs to know which leaf the walk reaches, which a
 * string scan does not. The failure direction is a MISSED dead key, never a false alarm — chosen
 * because a gate that cries wolf gets switched off (tempdoc 799 §O.1), which is the failure this
 * whole gate family exists to avoid.
