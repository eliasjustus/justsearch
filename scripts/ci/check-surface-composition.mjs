/**
 * surface-composition gate — tempdoc 571 §11 / 578 (the host/member composition one-home integrity),
 * extended by tempdoc 852 S0 with the FE↔Java surface-parity leg.
 *
 * LEG 1 — composition (571 §11 / 578). A host surface declares the member surfaces it presents inside
 * itself (rendered as tabs by `<jf-surface-tabs>`) via `.withMembers(List.of(new SurfaceRef("core.x"), …))`
 * in CoreSurfaceCatalog.java. Membership is the SINGLE home-authority: a member's home is its host, so it
 * is excluded from the rail (Shell) and its deep-link resolves to the host (catalogResolver). This gate
 * forecloses the contradictions that membership-as-an-improvisation used to permit (the original bug:
 * Logs both embedded in Health AND a stray rail icon):
 *
 *   1. a member that is ALSO a RAIL surface           → fail (two homes)
 *   2. a member hosted by TWO hosts                   → fail (ambiguous home)
 *   3. a member ref that resolves to no surface       → fail (dangling)
 *   4. a surface that hosts itself                    → fail
 *
 * This is referential integrity over a DECLARATION, not a derivation — it computes nothing from
 * consumed authority (altitude is the surface-altitude gate's concern; `members` is deliberately NOT an
 * input to SurfaceAltitude.derive, 578 §10 U1).
 *
 * LEG 2 — FE↔Java parity (tempdoc 852 §0.0, S0). A surface declared in BOTH files must agree on
 * `audience` and `placement`. The hole this closes is specific and it is the one the Search v3 promotion
 * walks through: the `interaction-surface` gate parses `CoreSurfaceCatalog.java` ONLY, and
 * `check-window-cutover` reads `CorePlugin.ts` ONLY. Neither can see a ONE-SIDED flip, so an implementer
 * who flips audience in just one file ships two USER/RAIL interaction windows (or a window the FE shows
 * and the wire does not) while every gate stays green — and satisfies the cutover forcing function while
 * doing it. This gate already loaded both files for leg 1's dangling-member resolution, so the parity
 * check is a leg on existing plumbing rather than a new gate. It ships four slices BEFORE the flip it
 * protects, because a safety introduced in the same commit that needs it has never been observed working.
 *
 * Both sources are comment-stripped before matching: a commented-out or merely discussed registration
 * must not count as a declaration (same technique, and the same reason, as check-window-cutover.mjs).
 *
 * Lighter scripts/ci tier; wired in the `ui-web-gates` recipe (governance/consult-register.v1.json).
 * With zero hosts declared leg 1 passes trivially (ready for the first host).
 *
 * Run: `node scripts/ci/check-surface-composition.mjs` (from the repo root).

/**
 * Pre-existing FE↔Java disagreements that predate this leg (tempdoc 852 S0), recorded rather than
 * silently tolerated. Each entry PINS the exact pair of values observed when the leg landed, so:
 *
 *   - observed pair === pinned pair  → WARN (a known, unresolved drift, not a new one)
 *   - observed pair !== pinned pair  → FAIL (either it was fixed and this entry is now stale and must be
 *                                      deleted, or it drifted FURTHER and that is new drift)
 *
 * The ledger therefore cannot be used to wave through a new one-sided flip, and it retires itself the
 * moment the underlying disagreement is settled. `core.search-v3-surface` and `core.unified-chat-surface`
 * are deliberately NOT here — those are the ids S0 exists to protect.
