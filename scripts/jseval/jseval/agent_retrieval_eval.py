"""Agent retrieval eval — measure JustSearch retrieve-context quality on MultiHop-RAG.

Phase 1: Retrieval quality (no agent, deterministic, $0 cost).
  Calls retrieve-context REST API for each question, checks if ground truth
  evidence documents appear in the retrieved chunks.

Phase 2: Agent comparison (requires Claude Code CLI, costs API tokens).
  Runs Claude Code with/without JustSearch MCP tools, scores answers against
  ground truth. Three conditions: A (file tools only), B (file + JustSearch),
  C (JustSearch only).

``run_agent_eval`` (this module's former Phase-2 `claude -p` shell-out runner)
was RETIRED in tempdoc 675: the classic subprocess-based agent-eval runner is
dead, replaced by the in-process SDK executor
(``jseval.agent_utility_inspect.run_utility_eval``). Records intended for
publication come from that Inspect-AI path
(``jseval.agent_utility_inspect`` / ``jseval.agent_utility_run.eval_logs_to_summaries``).

This module now holds the surviving Tier-1/Tier-2 retrieval runners --
``run_retrieval_eval`` (Phase 1: deterministic retrieve-context quality, $0
cost) and ``run_tier2_eval`` (single-shot RAG eval against a local LLM, $0
cost) -- plus shared helpers used by the Inspect-AI runner
(``stage_corpus_dir``, ``build_disallowed_tools``,
``find_disallowed_tool_calls``, ``find_leak_suspect_tool_calls``,
``_score_answer``, ``load_queries``) and the console formatters for all of
the above.

    `--add-dir corpus_dir` hands the Claude Code CLI's Read/Glob tools a directory
    that is NOT sandboxed against `../` relative-path traversal: with `corpus_dir`
    scoped to `datasets/golden/<name>/corpus-dir/`, an agent can `Read
    ../queries.json` — the sibling gold answer key materialized by
    `corpus_build.build_golden` — and the CLI does not block it. This is a real,
    live-verified leak (tempdoc 624 §M.7a "As-built #7": real eval cells where the
    agent read the answer key directly).

    Staging a copy into its own isolated temp root instead of passing the
    persistent `corpus-dir/` makes `queries.json` structurally absent from
    anywhere reachable by traversal from the staged path — a construction-time
    guarantee, not a permission workaround. Used by the surviving Inspect-AI

    helper was retired in tempdoc 675.

    `stable_key` (tempdoc 675 F0 resume fix): when given, stage to a DETERMINISTIC
    path keyed by a hash of `stable_key` (idempotent copy) instead of a random
    `mkdtemp`. The staged path is part of Inspect's `eval_set` task identity, so a
    resume must re-stage to the SAME path or the recomputed task-id won't match the
    persisted log (→ `PrerequisiteError`). Default (None) keeps the volatile per-call

    """Fail-closed check of the retrieval-completeness invariant (tempdoc 749): every
    sub-threshold (chunkless-by-construction) doc must still be reachable via the PRIMARY
    RAG path, not silently dropped by the ``IS_CHUNK:true`` chunk-retrieval filter.

    Samples the ``n`` shortest docs in ``corpus_path`` (a BEIR-format ``corpus.jsonl`` --
    see :func:`jseval.chunk_completeness.iter_corpus_docs`) whose materialized content length
    is < the backend's published chunk threshold -- these are the docs
    ``ChunkDocumentWriter`` writes zero chunk documents for (tempdoc 749's root cause), so a
    silent regression of the doc-level-union fix would make them invisible to
    ``/api/knowledge/retrieve-context`` again. Sample order is deterministic: ascending
    length, then doc id (ties broken lexically) -- so a fixed ``n`` samples the same docs
    run-to-run for a given corpus.

    For each sampled doc, probes with a scoped ``retrieve-context`` call (``doc_ids:
    [docid]``) using the doc's title as the question (falling back to the first 12
    whitespace-separated words of its text when the title is blank -- titles are usually a
    much better retrieval query than an arbitrary text prefix, but not every corpus doc has
    one). A doc PASSES iff the response's ``quality.retrieval_mode`` is not
    ``"FULLTEXT_FALLBACK"`` AND some returned chunk's ``parent_doc_id`` equals the doc id --
    i.e. the doc was actually found via the primary chunk-retrieval path, not the whole-doc
    BM25 fallback tempdoc 749 diagnosed as blind to this doc class.

    ``api_base_or_session`` accepts either a base URL (a fresh, self-closed
    ``httpx.Client(base_url=..., timeout=30.0)`` is created and used exactly like
    :func:`run_retrieval_eval`'s own client) or an already-open ``httpx.Client`` to reuse
    (e.g. ``run_retrieval_eval`` passing its own client so the probe doesn't open a second
    connection) -- the caller-supplied client is never closed here.

    ``threshold_chars`` is the chunk threshold to classify against. ``None`` (the default) reads
    it live from the backend's ``/api/status`` via the same client -- tempdoc 821 §3-C3 made the
    worker's enrichment auditor publish ``chunkMinChars``, retiring the jseval-side mirror of
    ``ChunkDocumentWriter.CHUNK_THRESHOLD_CHARS``. There is deliberately no local fallback
    constant (a fallback is the mirror again): a backend that does not publish it yields
    ``"not-applicable"``, the same never-blocking path an unreadable corpus takes.

    Returns ``{"sampled": int, "passed": int, "failed": [docid, ...], "verdict": "ok"|"fail"|
    "not-applicable"}``. ``"not-applicable"`` (not a failure) means there is no sub-threshold doc
    to check -- either ``corpus_path`` doesn't exist/is unreadable (mirrors
    :func:`jseval.chunk_completeness.expected_chunk_docs`'s graceful degradation for corpora
    with no local ``corpus.jsonl``, e.g. BEIR datasets materialized via ``ir_datasets``), every
    doc in it reaches the chunk threshold on its own, or the threshold itself is unavailable.
