"""ui-proportion-gate — the chrome proportion ratchet (tempdoc 697).

Mirrors `ui_a11y_gate.py`'s ASSERT shape: capture each step in the shared proportion
baseline register in the DETERMINISTIC `--fixtures` state, and fail (exit 1) if any
registered element violates a declared geometric constraint (originally only "this
persistent chrome must not GROW beyond `maxHeightPx`"; see the constraint table below).
This reuses the ONE baseline authority `governance/ui-proportion-baseline.v1.json`
and the ONE geometry capture `ui_measure.capture_measure` (which unions the baseline's
registered selectors into its shadow-piercing geometry probe), so the gate and the
`.measure.json` geometry it reads can never disagree about which elements were measured.
Local-first (ADR-0026): a runnable gate, not a CI-wired kernel gate.

Element-level constraint kinds, all read off the SAME captured rect. An element
declares whichever apply; declaring none is an error, not a silent pass. Two STEP-level
checks (not per-element) round out tempdoc 814's D7 enforcement list.

  ``maxHeightPx``            697's original shrink-only ratchet — persistent chrome must
                             not GROW. Shrinking is always clean.
  ``minHeightPx``            the CEILING's floor companion (814 review pass). A ceiling
                             alone is satisfied by an element that COLLAPSED: the Detailed
                             banner's 176px ceiling passes at 34px, i.e. exactly when
                             Detailed expansion has regressed to the collapsed pill and the
                             row is measuring the wrong element. A band whose whole point is
                             that it EXPANDS declares both bounds. (Same anti-vacuity move
                             as `minScrollableRegions` next to `maxScrollableRegions`.)
  ``minWidthPx``             a FLOOR for primary content — the surface that must not be
                             starved by the chrome around it. Added for the round-7
                             defect where the RAG answer column collapsed to ~one word
                             per line (measured 102px) while the evidence rail and the
                             document pane held their own min-widths.
  ``maxWidthPx``             tempdoc 816 — ``minWidthPx``'s symmetric CEILING, for an element
                             whose function-derived bound is its CONTAINER rather than a line
                             length. §3's ``control-row`` max is ``fit-content``, which no ``ch``
                             number can express, so "the chip row does not sprawl past the reading
                             column" is asserted physically on a pinned-viewport step — the same
                             contract ``maxHeightPx`` has carried since 697.
  ``inlineSizeRole``         tempdoc 816 §4a.2 — the ROLE indirection: the row names a role in the
                             register's ``roles`` block and the gate resolves that role's ``ch``
                             bounds against the element's OWN captured ``chPx`` (``ui_measure.py``'s
                             canvas measure of the "0" glyph in the element's rendered font). Width
                             is handed out top-down, so the unconsidered default is greedy 100% and
                             the right invariant is a per-element bound in CONTENT units — the
                             inline-axis complement of 814's block-axis budget-over-the-sum. The
                             same numbers RENDER as the ``--measure-*`` tokens, and
                             ``roleTokenEquality`` (below) asserts the two agree.
  ``mustNotOverlapSelector`` two rects must not intersect. Added for the round-7 defect
                             where an unbounded toast stack sat over the chat surface's
                             header control row. A height/width budget cannot express
                             this: each element was individually within budget — the
                             defect was the RELATION between them.
  ``minShareOfSelector``     tempdoc 814 D1/D7.1 — this element's rect.h divided by a
                             second registered selector's rect.h must be >= floor. The
                             "owner of the sum" assertion: primary content must own a
                             minimum SHARE of the surface, not just clear an absolute px
                             floor (a surface can shrink and keep its share, or grow
                             chrome and lose it — an absolute floor catches neither).
  ``maxBottomPx``            tempdoc 814 D6/D7.2 (the F5 close) — rect.y + rect.h must
                             not exceed this value, i.e. the element's bottom edge must
                             stay within a viewport of this height. Added for round 8's
                             F5: clearing results with the document pane open used to
                             clip the composer below a short viewport.

Step-level (not per-element; declared alongside ``elements`` on the step object):

  ``maxScrollableRegions``   tempdoc 814 D3/D7.2 — the one-scroller-per-surface rule.
                             Asserts ``geometry.scrollableCount`` (ui_measure.py's
                             shadow-piercing scrollable-element walk) does not exceed
                             the declared ceiling.
  ``minScrollableRegions``   the closure audit's finding C — a ceiling alone is VACUOUS on a
                             capture whose ``scrollableCount`` is 0: "at most one scroller"
                             passes trivially when the state never produces one, so the
                             one-scroller rule would keep reporting green through a
                             regression that removed the scroller entirely (or through a
                             setup that silently stopped reaching the overflowing state).
                             A step that is SUPPOSED to scroll declares this floor, and the
                             pair (min 1 / max 1) is what makes the rule witness a real
                             scroller.
  ``statusFactsSingleton``   tempdoc 814 D5/D7.3 — the "one authority, one pointer"
                             copy-lint. Asserts every phrase in
                             governance/status-facts.v1.json renders at most its
                             registered ``maxPersistentRenders`` times in this step's
                             captured DOM text (``ui_measure.py``'s statusFacts probe).
  ``absentSelectors``        a selector that must NOT be present in the captured
                             geometry (e.g. the run-spine on a single-turn conversation).
                             A present selector is a violation, not a silent pass —
                             mirrors the "declaring none is an error" discipline for the
                             positive case.
  ``nonScrollableSelectors`` tempdoc 814 §D8 — the §D3 rule's DIRECT witness on a NAMED
                             element: this selector must be present AND must not be a
                             scroller. `maxScrollableRegions` bounds the surface's TOTAL,
                             which is the right shape for "one scroller per surface" but
                             cannot say WHICH element is allowed to be it: a capture where
                             `.conversation` stopped scrolling and the evidence rail started
                             would still count 1 and pass. Judged off the registered
                             element's own `geometry.elements[sel].scrollable` flag —
                             computed by `ui_measure.py` with the SAME predicate that builds
                             `scrollableRegions`, so "not a scroller" and "absent from
                             scrollableRegions" are the same fact, addressed by the
                             registered selector rather than by the region walk's truncated
                             description string. A MISSING selector is a violation, not a
                             pass (a rail that never mounted must not satisfy "the rail does
                             not scroll").
  ``requiredSelectors``      `absentSelectors`' positive twin (814 §D7.2's spine PAIR):
                             a selector that MUST be present in the captured geometry.
                             Registered on the step, not as an element row, because the
                             assertion is presence itself — the step declares no budget for
                             it, and an element row with no constraint is an error by
                             design.
  ``forbiddenVisibleText``   a literal phrase that must not render VISIBLY in this step's
                             capture (814 §D5's chip-yield witness). Counted by the same
                             visibility-filtered `ui_measure.py` probe the status-facts
                             register feeds — the difference is scope: a status fact is
                             register-wide with a `maxPersistentRenders` ceiling, a
                             forbidden phrase is THIS step's state with a ceiling of 0.
                             It exists because the D5 chip-yield is a CROSS-WORDING
                             duplication (banner "Semantic search degraded." vs. chip
                             "Service degraded") that a same-phrase counter cannot witness:
                             what is decidable at capture time is that the surface owning
                             the banner does not ALSO show the chip's wording.
