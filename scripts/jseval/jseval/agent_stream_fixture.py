"""Deterministic agent-run SSE fixture (tempdoc 814 §D8.2).

The browser's agent path is `AgentSessionController.send()` -> `streamViaHost` ->
`host.ai.streamShape` -> **POST `/api/chat/dispatch`** (`plugin-api/capabilities/ai.ts`),
whose RESPONSE is the SSE stream. `ui_fixtures.install_fixtures` used to let that POST
fall through to the unmapped-JSON default `{}`: both stream parsers then saw no terminal
frame, `pumpHostAiStream` threw `STREAM_INCOMPLETE`, and the run ended as the
"Connection lost — the response was interrupted." row visible in the agent-mode captures.
This module supplies the missing body.

WHY A STATIC BODY IS ENOUGH: Playwright's `route.fulfill` can only serve a COMPLETE
body, but both parsers are buffer-based frame splitters (`ai.ts:parseSseStream` splits on
`\\n\\n`; `api/streams.ts` does the same), so one whole multi-frame body yields every
event in order — byte-stable, which is exactly what a capture wants. The cost is recorded
in §D8.3: a stream that never terminates (the PAUSED-awaiting-budget state) is NOT
reachable this way.

SCHEMA AUTHORITY (projection, not fork): every payload here is validated at IMPORT time
against `scripts/codegen/shapes.fixture.json`'s `core.agent-run` `eventSchema` — the
machine-readable projection of the Java conversation-shape catalog, which is off-wire so
the `wire` gate cannot cover this drift. A catalog change that renames/retypes a field
breaks THIS module loudly, naming the event and the field, instead of leaving capture
assertions passing against a stale shape.

# carried sources the rail would be over-determined and that negative control would stay green.
