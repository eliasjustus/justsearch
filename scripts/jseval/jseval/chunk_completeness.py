"""Eval-time chunk-completeness validity guard (tempdoc 718).

A fresh index build can silently ship with its chunk sub-system absent (tempdoc 717): a
degenerate build reads bit-for-bit identical to a legitimately chunk-free corpus at the
*pipeline output* layer -- ``chunkDocCount=0``, ``chunkVectorCoveragePercent=0.0`` both ways
(``LuceneRuntimeTypes.coveragePercent()`` returns ``0.0`` when ``total==0``, never a vacuous
100%). No attempted-vs-completed counter exists, so the *observed* signal alone cannot
distinguish "short docs, nothing to chunk" from "build degenerated."

The disambiguator is an OFFLINE signal the degeneracy can't touch: :func:`expected_chunk_docs`
computes, straight from the corpus TEXT, how many documents SHOULD have produced chunk docs --
before/independent of any ingest, so a broken enrichment pipeline can never move this number.
:func:`chunk_completeness_verdict` is the pure comparison of that offline expectation against
the post-enrichment observed counts; :mod:`jseval.ratchet_kernel` enforces it at the gate seam.
