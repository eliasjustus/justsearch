"""Shared ratchet-gate kernel (tempdoc 640 K).

The three engine-quality gates — relevance (`relevance_gate`), performance (`perf_gate`), and
recall-leak (`leak_gate`) — and the new LLM-generation gate all duplicate the same CLI orchestration:
load the baselines file (optionally projecting floors from a `current_release` pointer), locate the run
dir, read the run's source artifact, call the family's `evaluate`, then emit a 0/1/2 report. They
differ only in the *source* (per-mode/per-run `summary.json` vs a projection artifact vs a bench file),
the comparator (which lives inside each family's `evaluate`), and a few family-specific options. This
module owns the SHARED parts so a new family reuses them instead of forking a fourth copy; the
per-family `evaluate`/`project` functions stay in their own modules.

The pure helpers (`load_baselines_doc`, `build_summary`) are unit-testable; `resolve_run_dir` /
`finalize_report` do CLI I/O (echo + `sys.exit`) and are exercised by the live gate runs.
