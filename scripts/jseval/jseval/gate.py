"""Phase 3 observability nightly gate (tempdoc 400 §26.6 Decision 4).

Phase 6 / 6.13: module relocated from ``scripts/ci/phase3_observability_gate.py``
into the ``jseval`` package so operators can invoke it via the same
``jseval`` CLI as every other Phase 3/4/5/6 subcommand. The public
surface (``evaluate`` + ``REQUIRED_PROJECTIONS`` + helper functions)
is unchanged; the argparse shim was dropped in favour of the
``jseval gate`` Click subcommand in :mod:`jseval.cli`.

Validates the latest eval-results run directory produced by the Phase 3
nightly workflow:

1. The run has a readable ``manifest.json`` (its ``manifest_hash`` is
   reported as the run's cohort identity).
2. It has a populated ``projections/`` directory with the LR4-* outputs
   actually produced (no hard-fail on any single projection status, but
   at least ``contract_violations`` + ``rate_timeline`` +
   ``stratified_metrics`` + ``bootstrap_ci`` must exist).

Tempdoc 930 §18.1 row 7 removed the σ-band arm: it compared the cohort's
calibrated ``envelope.json`` against a pinned ``--baseline-stdev``, and no
``cohort_baselines/`` directory ever existed on any machine, so that arm
could only ever report the infra exit.

Exit codes (see :func:`jseval.commands.gates.cmd_gate`):

- 0 — gate passed.
- 1 — a hard assertion failed (manifest unreadable, required projection
  absent).
- 2 — data-layout problem (no eval-results run found) — usually an infra
  issue, not a quality drift.

    :func:`jseval.release.canonical_dataset_slug`) — picking the latest MATCHING run
    instead of the latest run overall. Without this filter, a data-dir holding runs for
    two different datasets silently resolves to whichever run sorts latest by directory

    corpus's metrics against the requested dataset's baseline with no error (a real
    incident: a two-dataset eval-results/ compared the wrong corpus's nDCG@10). Returns
    ``None`` (the caller's existing "no run found" hard-error path) rather than silently
    falling back to the overall-latest run when no candidate matches.
