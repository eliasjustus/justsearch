"""Pre-run calibration + readiness pass for the agent-utility eval (tempdoc 624).

The floor run committed $30 + 40 min blind: it ran on a degraded index, picked
timeout/concurrency from a guess (→ 26 % timeout), and labelled the search cohort
by hand. This module is the cheap pre-pass that *conditions* the expensive run —
the agent-eval instance of the `calibrate`/`readiness`/`preflight` seam:

1. **Readiness gate** — reuse `readiness.check_search_ready` (dense+sparse).
2. **Pin the real `config_cohort_key`** — reuse `manifest` snapshots +
   `release.config_cohort_key` (confidence pass #3 B3: `/api/debug/commit-metadata`,
   NOT `/api/status`, which carries the corpus-dependent fps).
3. **Pilot at the *target* concurrency** → `timeout ≈ 2× contended-p95`
   (confidence pass #3 B1: a *low*-concurrency pilot underestimates ~1.8×).
4. **Closed-book filter** — drop the memorizable queries (confidence pass #3 B2:
   the kept set ~doubles the C-beats-A signal).

The output is a `calibration` dict that `jseval utility-run --calibration` consumes.
