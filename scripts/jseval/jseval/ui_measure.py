"""Structured measurement companion for ui-shot / ui-check (tempdoc 615 §6.2).

The tempdoc's thesis is *measurement-first*: capture FACTS alongside every
screenshot — the accessibility tree, axe WCAG violations, key-element
geometry/computed-style, overflow flags, and console errors — so a correctness
judgment can target the measurement instead of the pixels. The screenshot
demotes to a non-asserting gestalt attachment (§6.2 / P2).

Reuses, rather than reinvents:
- Playwright's NATIVE `page.accessibility.snapshot()` as the live perception
  channel (§6.3 "reuse the a11y substrate").
- the SAME axe-core bundle the Node e2e harness uses
  (`modules/ui-web/node_modules/axe-core/axe.min.js`), injected via
  `add_script_tag` — mirrors `e2e/ai-harness.ts` `checkAccessibility()`.
- the console-collector pattern from `e2e/ai-harness.ts` `setupConsoleCollector`.
