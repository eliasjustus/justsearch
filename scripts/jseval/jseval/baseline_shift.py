"""Baseline-shift-detection convention, ported into jseval's Python ratchets (tempdoc 664).

Ports the *shape* (not the literal mechanism) of the discipline-gate kernel's
changeset-justification protocol (``scripts/governance/lib/git-utils.mjs`` +
``changeset-loader.mjs``, tempdoc 530) into jseval's own ratchet re-pin commands
(``perf-gate --update-baseline``, ``leak-gate-derive``, ``jseval release`` recompose).
Deliberately does NOT pull jseval into the JS kernel itself — jseval's ratchets are
advisory/live-stack-dependent, the JS kernel's gates are fast-CI-blocking; the RUNTIME
boundary between them is intentional (tempdoc 664 §Design). Only the CONVENTION — "a
floor can't be silently relaxed without a classified, justified changeset" — is reused,
reimplemented natively in Python so jseval doesn't need to invoke Node.

Reuses this codebase's own existing idioms rather than inventing new ones:

- git subprocess calls mirror ``manifest.py:_git_sha_full``'s
  ``subprocess.run(["git", ...])`` shape.
- YAML frontmatter parsing reuses the PyYAML dependency already required by
  ``run_config.py`` — no new dependency.

The concrete finding this closes (tempdoc 664 confidence-building pass):
``perf-ratchet-baselines.v1.json`` itself carries a comment admitting a relevance floor was
"re-baselined in the same recompose to the user-accepted post-636 levels (enron/courtlistener
drops)" — an unguarded relaxation, laundered through a re-pin command with no safeguard.

**Honest limit (tempdoc 664 post-review correction):** ``git_diff_added_modified`` implements
the JS kernel's PR-scope anti-replay semantics (a changeset merged long before the relaxation
being checked doesn't count), but none of the three real call sites currently pass a
``baseline_ref`` — they all use ``load_changesets``'s local/fixture mode (every ``.md`` file
present is loaded, regardless of when it was added). This is a deliberate simplification given
jseval's ratchets are locally-run and not scoped to a CI PR the way the JS kernel's gates are —
but it means a single changeset currently justifies EVERY future relaxation of its declared
``(gate, dataset)``, not just the one it was originally written for. A human must still author a
``tempdoc:``-justified changeset before any relaxation is accepted at all; there is currently no
mechanism preventing that same changeset from silently covering a later, unrelated regression.
