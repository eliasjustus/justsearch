"""Fetch + deterministically sample real external IR datasets into this project's committed corpus
source shape (tempdoc 666).

Neither corpus's *materialized* content is ever committed here — `datasets/` is wholesale gitignored,
this project's existing, universal policy for every corpus regardless of source (confirmed via
`.gitignore:211`; the original `mixed/courtlistener-200` files found in the private archive's history
were themselves stripped out during the public-release cutover, never present in this repo). What's
committed instead is a small **recipe** (mirroring `corpus_generate.py`'s `generation_provenance`
discipline): source id, seed, and target sizes — see `scripts/jseval/666-corpora/<name>/recipe.json`.
Re-running the recipe re-fetches and re-samples deterministically; nothing about the corpus content
itself needs to be preserved in git.

The recorded provenance is written under the `generation_provenance` key (not a differently-named one) so
`corpus_build.build_golden()` — which only threads through `src_meta.get("generation_provenance")` — actually
carries it into the materialized `metadata.json` rather than silently dropping it (tempdoc 666, fourth-pass
fix). Deliberately no `suite` key is set here: these are real external corpora, not tempdoc-635 self-demo
suite members, and `corpora._validate_golden_set()` treats any non-empty `suite` as exactly that, firing
warnings (`closed_book_certification`/`fidelity`/`descriptor_collisions`/`regeneration_determinism`) that are
meaningless for a real BEIR-style corpus — confirmed live before this fix (loading `mixed/miracl-de-2k`
produced all four).

Three sources:
- **MIRACL** (Apache 2.0) via the already-installed `ir_datasets` dependency — no new dependency.
- **CLERC** — its own added structure (query/positive/negative construction on top of the Caselaw Access
  Project) has no stated license anywhere, checked exhaustively (tempdoc 666, second pass: the GitHub
  repo's file listing via the GitHub API, GitHub's own license detector, the HuggingFace Hub API's dataset
  card metadata, and a full-text search of the paper's Ethical Considerations/Data Availability sections —
  all confirm no license is stated). Its underlying source (the Caselaw Access Project) is CC0. Nothing
  from CLERC is ever committed here — this module only ever writes to the gitignored `datasets/` tree,
  fetching fresh each time, the same "fetch, never commit" policy this project already applies to every
  BEIR corpus (SciFact, NFCorpus, etc. are never committed either).
- **Enron raw mail** (`fetch_enron_raw_sample`, tempdoc 707) — the CMU distribution of the raw Enron
  maildir corpus, released as a public FERC record with no stated redistribution restriction. Unlike
  MIRACL/CLERC above, this fetcher samples ONLY real email bodies — no queries/qrels of any kind — since
  the 707 en-email member's queries and gold come entirely from its own fabricated `635-corpora` source,
  injected over these real bodies by `corpus-inject-real` (which never reads a real corpus's own
  queries.json — see `corpus_inject.build_source`). The previously-scoped MichaelR207/enron_qa_0922
  question/answer annotations are unlicensed and are dropped entirely, never fetched by this module
  (tempdoc 707 ratified decision, §Archived decision memos).

CLERC's raw fetch (qrels/queries text + the several-GB document collection) and the Enron raw fetch (the
~1.7 GB maildir tarball) both go through `dataset_cache.cached_dir` (tempdoc 709): a shared, cross-worktree,
gitignored, integrity-verified on-disk cache of the raw upstream bytes under the MAIN checkout, so the
GB-scale stream isn't re-downloaded once per worktree per day. This is purely a network-trip dedupe of the
same "fetch fresh, never commit/redistribute" bytes this module already only ever writes to a gitignored
tree — it changes nothing about the licensing posture above.

    `ir_datasets`-registered), sample `n_queries` deterministically, and pull their qrelled documents
    from the (large — several GB) document collection.

    The raw fetch of all three artifacts goes through `dataset_cache.cached_dir` (tempdoc 709): a
    shared, cross-worktree, integrity-verified on-disk cache keyed on `base` alone (independent of
    `seed`/`n_queries`/`n_docs` — the raw bytes don't depend on how they're later sampled), so a
    same-day rerun in a different worktree (or a different seed/sample-size in the same worktree)
    reuses the already-downloaded collection instead of re-streaming several GB over the network
    again. When the shared cache is disabled (`JUSTSEARCH_DATASET_CACHE=0`) or unavailable, this
    falls back to a direct, uncached, ephemeral fetch — identical to this function's pre-709 behavior.

    `n_docs=None` (default) keeps the original qrelled-only behavior byte-compatible (including the
    early `break` once every wanted doc is found, now scanning the locally-cached collection file
    rather than a live network stream) so existing callers and the committed
    `666-corpora/legal-clerc-200/recipe.json` reproduction path are unaffected. When `n_docs` is set,
    mirrors `fetch_miracl_sample`'s pattern: the qrelled docs are kept, and `n_docs - len(wanted)`
    additional distractor documents are deterministically reservoir-sampled from the rest of the same
    pass (so the early break must NOT fire — the full collection needs to be seen for the
    reservoir sample to be uniform). Distractor sampling uses its own `random.Random(seed)` instance,
    separate from the `rng` used for query sampling above, so the sampled qrelled-doc set is identical
    across every `n_docs` value at a given `(seed, n_queries)` — verified in
    `test_fetch_clerc_sample_qrel_set_is_invariant_to_n_docs`.

    Uses the "single-removed/direct" task variant (the citing sentence with its citation redacted, as
    the query text; direct citation as the qrel) — the most standard of CLERC's four retrieval-task
    variants. See this module's docstring for the licensing note this design already accounts for.
