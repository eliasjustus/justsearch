"""Local Docker-free OTLP/HTTP sink for developer-agent telemetry (tempdoc 622,
Layer A). Receives native Claude Code OTLP traces/metrics/logs, decodes the
protobuf, and appends normalized JSON lines to tmp/agent-telemetry/otlp/.

This is the canonical on-machine sink the analytics scripts ingest from
(telemetry-io.mjs `loadEventsFromSource('otlp')`). It is intentionally minimal
and dependency-light (opentelemetry-proto + stdlib) so it runs on a bare Python
without Docker or a full collector.

Usage:  python scripts/agent-analytics/otlp-sink.py [--port 4318] [--out DIR]
Endpoints (OTLP/HTTP, protobuf): POST /v1/traces, /v1/metrics, /v1/logs
Streams written: traces / metrics / logs (one per endpoint, verbatim) plus
`ledger.ndjson`, the body-free projection of logs that carries the numbers on
a long retention while the raw bodies age out (see LEDGER_KEEP below).

# --- gen_ai.* normalisation (tempdoc 886 §12 PR 3, §10.3 option B) --------
# Both harnesses this sink receives emit their own token-usage metric under a
# harness-specific name and attribute vocabulary (Claude:
# `claude_code.token.usage{type}`; Codex: `codex.turn.token_usage{token_type}`).
# Neither emits the OTel GenAI semantic-convention names
# (`gen_ai.usage.*` / `gen_ai.token.kind`), so a downstream reader that wants
# "tokens by kind, harness-neutral" has to special-case every harness's own
# vocabulary. This table is additive and one entry per harness: it does not
# touch the original decoded records (kept verbatim, unchanged shape) and
# instead appends a normalised TWIN record alongside them for every data
# point whose raw type is a known token kind. A third harness is one new
# entry here, not a new code path.
#
# Deliberately flat (not nested "points" like the original per-metric-batch
# record): the acceptance criterion is "one normalised record per data
# point", which is what a per-token-kind consumer actually wants to filter
# on (`record.name == 'gen_ai.usage' and record.attributes['gen_ai.token.kind']
# == 'cache_read'`) without re-flattening a points array first.
#
# Written to the SAME metrics.ndjson stream as the originals (these records
# are appended into decode_metrics' own `out` list, so do_POST's existing
# rotate/prune/write path for "/v1/metrics" picks them up with no separate
# plumbing) rather than a second `metrics.genai.ndjson` file -- one rotation
# policy, one RETENTION entry, one archive-glob to keep in sync, and metrics
# is already the stream that is never pruned (RETENTION["metrics"] = None),
# which the normalised records need exactly as much as the originals do.

# rotates every ~25 minutes of active work (~1 GB/active day) and RETENTION
# can only keep a couple of archives -- which means the numbers analytics
# actually reads (tokens, cost, durations, per-tool outcomes) age out of the
# capture within an hour, together with the bodies nothing reads.
#
# The ledger separates those two lifetimes. It is a PROJECTION of the same
# decoded log records (not a second capture authority): the route below still
# writes logs.ndjson verbatim first, and every ledger row is derived from a
# record already in that batch. Rows carry an allow-listed, body-free
# attribute subset, so the stream runs ~1 MB/day and 90 archives of 20 MB is
# years of history rather than hours.
#
# Written as its own base name (not appended into logs.ndjson) precisely
# because the point is a SEPARATE retention policy -- one rotation policy per
# base name is the sink's existing shape, so a second lifetime needs a second
