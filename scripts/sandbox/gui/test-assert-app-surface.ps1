.SYNOPSIS
    Self-test for Assert-AppSurface's ledger predicate (round 15 fix, tempdoc 817).

.DESCRIPTION
    Assert-AppSurface used to check ONLY `kind == "navigation"` / "targetSurface",
    which is the shape a BACKEND-driven navigation gets (BackendIntentRouterImpl,
    e.g. an agent/MCP-initiated nav). A real GUI-driven click never goes through
    that path -- it's FE-local and bridges into the ledger as
    `kind == "effect"`, `effectKind == "navigate"`, `subject == "<route>"`
    (ActionLedgerClient.ts startEffectIngest -> POST /api/action-ledger/events).
    Round 15 observed exactly that shape and got "no navigation entries in
    action-ledger" on a click that had genuinely succeeded.

    This script exercises the fixed predicate against a captured fixture payload
    (fixtures/action-ledger-sample.json) with NO network calls, via
    Assert-AppSurface's -Entries self-test seam. No Pester dependency (none is
    staged in this repo) -- plain PowerShell 5.1, exits 0 on all-pass, 1 otherwise.
