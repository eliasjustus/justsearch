# Conflict Ledger

This ledger records **conflicts, intentional reframes, and unresolved authority
questions** that surface during slice / substrate work, together with their current
handling. It is the artifact the slice-execution closure protocol writes to.

## The closure protocol (implementer ≠ resolver)

When a slice or substrate change surfaces a conflict, record a row here. The
load-bearing discipline:

> **The agent or reviewer resolving a conflict should not be the same agent who
> originally flagged it.** Single-agent self-validation rests on the same blind
> spots as the implementation.

This protocol is defined in full in
[`slice-execution.md`](slice-execution.md) (§"closure protocol"); a conflict row
here is one of the override artifacts that doc requires (alongside the commit
message naming the verdict and a committed follow-up slice id). See also the
`independent-reviewer-required` and `ux-audit-closure` rows in
`.claude/rules/tier-register.md`.

## How to add a row

1. Give the conflict a stable `C-NNN` id (next free number).
2. State the conflict and its current handling.
3. On resolution, a *different* agent/reviewer records the resolution direction
   and links the follow-up slice/ADR.

## Open conflicts

| ID | Conflict | Current handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | *(none currently open)* | — |

## History

The historical `C-001 … C-018` conflict family was authored during the
frontend-rewrite kernel work (the retired `421` draft, ~2026-05) and was retired
with that draft on 2026-06-09. Those rows are preserved in git history; the
substrate-discipline lessons they produced live on as named principles in
`docs/reference/contributing/agent-postmortems.md` and `.claude/rules/tier-register.md`
(rows `independent-reviewer-required`, `substrate-without-consumer-flavors`, etc.).
