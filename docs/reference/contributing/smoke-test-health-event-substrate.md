# Smoke test: HealthEvent Resource substrate

This procedure executes the `verification gate` items 3-10 + 7a deferred at slice 430's merge to `main`. It is the closure step for slice 1.1.a (HealthEvent Resource).

Run this procedure once before relying on the substrate for downstream slices (Log/Table Resource instances inheriting `ResourceAreaValidator`).

## Prerequisites

- Backend not already running on port 33221.
- Worker distribution built: `./gradlew.bat assemble` (wires in `installDist`).
- Models directory present (or set `JUSTSEARCH_MODELS_DIR`).
- Item 8 additionally requires `--llm` (Brain/llama-server). Skip item 8 if not testing AI-mediated paths.

## Quick procedure

In one terminal, start the backend in eval mode:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat runHeadlessEval
```

Wait for "ready" (worker port emit + ~38s to worker ready). In a second terminal, run the read-only checks:

```powershell
.\scripts\smoke\health-event-substrate.ps1   # see Automatable section below
```

For interactive triggers, use the per-item commands below.

## Items

### Item 3 — `/api/registry/resources` returns `health.events`

```powershell
curl http://127.0.0.1:33221/api/registry/resources | ConvertFrom-Json |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty entries |
  Where-Object { $_.id.value -eq 'core.health-events' }
```

Expected: one entry with `subscriptionMode = "SSE_STREAM"`, `endpoint = "/api/health/events/stream"`, `kind = "health-event-stream"`. Note: the `id` field serializes as `{"value": "core.health-events"}` (an `OperationId` value object), not a bare string.

### Item 4 — `/api/messages/health-events/en` serves the i18n catalog

```powershell
$resp = Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:33221/api/messages/health-events/en
$resp.Headers['ETag']
$resp.Headers['Cache-Control']
($resp.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).keys.PSObject.Properties.Count
```

Expected: ETag header present; `Cache-Control: max-age=3600`; key count >= 23 (one per backend-emitted catalog ID).

### Item 5 — `/api/health/events/stream` SSE works

```powershell
curl -H "Accept: text/event-stream" --no-buffer http://127.0.0.1:33221/api/health/events/stream
```

Expected: `event: snapshot` followed by JSON containing current `conditions` + recent `occurrences`. Heartbeats every 15s (per `HealthEventStreamController.HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`). Leave this running; it will receive `event: delta` frames as later items fire.

**Important**: the `Accept: text/event-stream` header is required. Without it, the endpoint returns `200 OK` with `Content-Type: text/plain` and `Content-Length: 0` (Javalin content-negotiation default). SSE clients (`EventSource`, `@microsoft/fetch-event-source`) send the header automatically; ad-hoc curl/PowerShell users must include it explicitly.

### Item 6 — Condition transition (worker kill)

In a third terminal, with the SSE stream from item 5 still connected:

```powershell
$workerPid = (Get-Process java | Where-Object { $_.MainWindowTitle -like '*indexer-worker*' } | Select-Object -First 1).Id
Stop-Process -Id $workerPid -Force
```

Watch the SSE stream: a `delta` event with `kind = CONDITION_ASSERTED`, `id = "index.unavailable"`, `status = TRUE` should fire. The supervisor restarts the worker; once ready, a `kind = CONDITION_REMOVED` delta should clear it.

### Item 7 — Threshold via bridge (throughput stall)

Source-of-emit: `LifecycleSnapshotTap` (per rev 3.7 §B.T.1; the `WorkerHealthEvents` bridge was dropped from V1).

**Status: trigger flag not built.** The 430 spec referenced `jseval run --reduce-throughput`; this flag does not exist in the current jseval CLI (`python -m jseval run --help` confirms). Achieving a deterministic throughput stall requires either:

- Adding a `--reduce-throughput` flag to jseval (deliberate slowdown injection), or
- Manually exercising a degraded scenario (e.g., starve the worker of CPU via `Set-ProcessAffinity`, then submit an indexing workload).

Until either path is in place, item 7's substrate path is validated indirectly: item 6 already exercises the same `LifecycleSnapshotTap` → `ConditionStore` → SSE delivery chain through worker death (different trigger, same path). The structural validation holds; only the throughput-specific reason code is unverified.

Track as deferred: see `docs/observations.md` and slice 1.3 spec-tightening pass for whether to add the flag.

### Item 7a — Threshold via rule engine (memory pressure)

Apply heap pressure (load a large corpus or run an indexing job that holds memory):

```powershell
cd scripts\jseval
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = 'utf-8'
python -m jseval ingest-bench --dataset scifact --concurrent 8
```

After `for: 60s` dwell, watch the SSE stream for `memory.pressure` ThresholdState `FIRING`. Stop the workload; after `keep_firing_for: 30s` grace, observe `RESOLVED`.

**Note: heap pressure is on the HEAD process, not the worker** (the rule engine consumes head-side `RrdMetricStore` per slice 430 §A.9). `ingest-bench --concurrent 8` primarily exercises the worker; head heap doesn't necessarily exceed 90% from this workload alone. To reliably trigger 7a, you may need to lower `-Xmx` on `runHeadlessEval` (e.g., 256m) or run a JMH-style head-side allocation harness. As of 2026-05-05, no built-in trigger exists; the rule engine's substrate is unit-tested (`DwellTimeSchedulerTest`, `RuleRunnerTest` per slice 430), but the live end-to-end dwell-time path is unvalidated.

### Item 8 — Lifecycle event (agent session)

Requires `--llm` and a configured runtime. Complete an agent session (e.g., via the FE agent surface or directly via `/api/chat/agent/...`).

Watch the SSE stream: `agent.session.completed` LifecycleEvent should appear when the session finishes normally.

### Item 9 — Capability catalog mutation broadcast

```powershell
curl --no-buffer http://127.0.0.1:33221/infra/capabilities/stream
```

At backend boot, `HealthResourceCatalog.register()` increments `catalogVersion`; subscribers see a `modified` event. To trigger again mid-session, restart the backend with the SSE connection from a third terminal still running.

### Item 10 — FE consumer renders streamed events

With the dev stack running and the FE dev server up:

```powershell
cd modules\ui-web
npm run dev
```

Open the Health view. Trigger item 6 (worker kill); the banner should appear from the SSE stream, not from `/api/status` polling. Verify by killing `/api/status` connection at devtools network panel — Health view should still update.

## Outcome recording

When the smoke is complete, append the result to `archive/source-tempdocs/430-slice-1-1-a-health-event-catalog.md` as the closure entry, recording:

- Items passed.
- Items skipped + reason (e.g., item 8 skipped because `--llm` not configured).
- Any deltas observed that don't match the spec (these become rev 3.21+ entries or new tempdoc findings).

## Reusable for future Resource-instance slices

Slices 1.3 (Log Resource, Table Resource) inherit `ResourceAreaValidator` from 430 §B.AG. The structure of this smoke procedure (registry entry + i18n catalog + SSE stream + condition/event triggers) generalizes; adapt the per-item commands when those slices ship.
