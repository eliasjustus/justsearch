# Verify an Update Preserves the User's Models

[ADR-0024](../decisions/0024-app-packaging-nsis-per-user-download.md) ships the
app without model weights and downloads them after install. Tempdoc 617 D2 then chose
**monolithic full-installer updates** on one condition: the models already on disk — up to ~9 GB —
are reused in place and are never re-downloaded or deleted by an update.

A monolithic update runs uninstall-then-install over an existing install, so the two ways to break
that condition are both one careless line: the packaging surface starts carrying model weights, or
an uninstall hook recursively deletes a user-data root. Neither shows up until a real user upgrades.

Two things guard it, at different strengths:

| Guard | What it proves | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| `node scripts/ci/check-update-preserves-models.mjs` | The **declared** surface is clean: no model weights in `tauri.conf.json` `bundle.resources`, none staged by `bundleSidecarResources`, no recursive `RMDir /r` and no delete under a user-data root in `installer-hooks.nsh`. | Static. Says nothing about a built installer. |
| `.github/workflows/update-preserves-models.yml` | A **real** published installer N, upgraded by a real installer N+1, leaves seeded model bytes identical — and so does the uninstaller. | Only the installer-over-release half; the app is never launched. |

## Run the lane

`workflow_dispatch` only ([ADR-0026](../decisions/0026-manual-ci-triggering.md)), on
`windows-latest`, ~15 min:

```bash
gh workflow run update-preserves-models.yml
gh run list --workflow=update-preserves-models.yml --limit=1
```

Inputs:

| Input | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `base_release_tag` | `v0.1.0` | Release whose published installer plays version **N**. |
| `candidate_source` | `release` | `release`, or `run-artifact` to gate an unpublished build. |
| `candidate_release_tag` | `v0.2.0` | Release whose published installer plays **N+1**. |
| `candidate_run_id` | *(empty)* | `build-installer.yml` run id supplying N+1 when `candidate_source: run-artifact`. Artifacts expire after 7 days. |

To gate a candidate **before** publishing it, dispatch `build-installer.yml`, then feed its run id:

```bash
gh workflow run update-preserves-models.yml \
  -f base_release_tag=v0.2.0 -f candidate_source=run-artifact -f candidate_run_id=<id>
```

The run uploads `update-preserves-models-evidence` containing
`update-preserves-models.v1.json` (schema `justsearch.update-preserves-models.v1`: both installer
versions, every seeded path with its sha256/size/mtime at three points in time, per-step pass/fail,
the before/after deletion diffs, and a `verdict`). The job summary carries a one-line verdict.

## What the lane does

1. Refuses to proceed unless the runner has no pre-existing JustSearch install — an ambiguous
   machine cannot produce a meaningful measurement.
2. Installs N with `/S`. `installMode: currentUser` means no admin prompt and no interactive page,
   so this works unattended on a hosted runner.
3. Seeds model files and records each one's sha256, size and mtime:
   - **Gating** — `%APPDATA%\io.justsearch.shell\models\…`. The packaged shell passes
     `-Djustsearch.data.dir=<app_data_dir>` and `JUSTSEARCH_HOME=<app_data_dir>` to the backend
     (`modules/shell/src-tauri/src/lib.rs:770-791`) and creates `<app_data_dir>\models` itself
     (`lib.rs:430`, `lib.rs:575`), so this is where a real user's weights live.
   - **Observational** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JustSearch\models\…`. This is the contract default data
     dir (`platform_paths.rs`, `ResolvedPathResolver.java:66`) **and** the NSIS `currentUser`
     `$INSTDIR`. The two collide, so anything seeded there sits inside the directory the
     uninstaller owns; the lane records the outcome instead of asserting one.
   The large blob is created by writing a random header then `SetLength`, so a 256 MB "weight
   file" costs milliseconds and near-zero disk while still having a distinctive hash.
4. Installs N+1 with `/S` over it, and asserts this was a genuine **upgrade** — exactly one
   Add/Remove Programs entry, with `DisplayVersion` advanced. Two entries would mean a
   side-by-side install, which would make a "models survived" pass meaningless.
5. Asserts every gating seed is byte-identical (sha256 **and** mtime).
6. Runs the uninstaller from the registry `UninstallString` with `/S` and asserts the gating seeds
   are *still* identical. ADR-0024 preserves user data on uninstall as well
   (tempdoc 374:1297-1299, 374:2350), so this is asserted, not merely observed.

Every step fails closed, and the evidence JSON is written even on an unexpected exception.

## What it does not cover

- **Nothing at runtime.** The installed app is never launched, so this does not prove the app
  refrains from re-downloading models after an update — only that the installer does not remove
  them.
- **Not the in-app updater.** Tempdoc 617 §9 item 4 (the in-app N→N+1 path through normal commit
  plus an interruption/reconciliation case) still needs a GUI Sandbox host. This lane supersedes
  only item 3 ("the exact published installer-over-release lane") and the model-survival half of
  item 5.
- **Not scale.** The ~9 GB figure is mimicked by a sparse blob, not reproduced.
- **Not the install-tree collision.** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JustSearch\models` is recorded, not gated.

## Why it downloads two published installers instead of building one

`build-installer.yml`'s build job declares `environment: release-signing`, which carries a
`required_reviewers` protection rule. A `workflow_call` into it would park awaiting a human
approval, so a reusable-workflow design could never run unattended. Using two already published
release assets is both autonomous and literally what tempdoc 617 §9 item 3 asks for. The
`candidate_source: run-artifact` path covers the pre-publication case without that constraint,
because a `build-installer.yml` artifact is downloaded rather than produced in-lane.

- `docs/how-to/cut-a-release.md` — the release checklist; this lane is a pre-publication step.
- `scripts/release/sandbox-silent-install-test.ps1` — the GUI Sandbox silent install/uninstall
  harness. Complementary: it covers first-install cleanliness, this lane covers upgrade survival.
