# ADR-0046: Local API trust boundary

## Status

Accepted (2026-09-02).

Written retroactively. The controls below shipped incrementally across tempdocs 633, 655 and 834;
what did not exist was a decision record naming *what they collectively defend against and what
they deliberately do not*. Root `CLAUDE.md` hard invariant #2 said "Local API binds to 127.0.0.1
only" — true, but a description of one control rather than of the posture. This ADR is the posture;
the invariant line now points here.

## Context

JustSearch's Head process serves a local HTTP API (Javalin) consumed by three kinds of caller:

1. the desktop shell (Tauri webview, origin `tauri://localhost`);
2. external MCP clients — native processes such as the MCPB bridge
   (`packaging/mcpb/server/index.js`) and `scripts/prod/justsearch-mcp/discovery.mjs`;
3. developer tooling (dev-runner, jseval, ui-shot) in dev mode.

The adversaries that are actually reachable on a single-user desktop are narrow, and naming them is
what makes the control set legible:

- **A remote host on the network.** Barred entirely by the bind address.
- **A malicious web page in the user's browser**, using the browser as a confused deputy —
  cross-origin `fetch` and DNS rebinding.
- **Another native process running as the same user.**

The third one is the important admission: a same-user native process can already read the data
directory and the runtime manifest, which is exactly where the desktop shell itself obtains the
session token (`modules/shell/src-tauri/src/binding.rs:116`). No HTTP-layer control can exclude a
caller that can read the token off disk. `docs/reference/security/threat-model.md` (Elevation of
privilege section) records this residual with its verified caller inventory.

## Decision

**The trust boundary is the same-user native process. Everything inside it is trusted; the browser
is outside it, and the network does not reach it.**

Five controls implement that boundary. The first is the bind address itself, in
`modules/ui/src/main/java/io/justsearch/ui/api/LocalApiServer.java`; the other four live in
`modules/ui/src/main/java/io/justsearch/ui/api/ApiSecurityFilters.java` and are installed as
before-filters, in a fixed order, by `install(Javalin)` (`:138-145`) — which the server calls
immediately before it binds (`LocalApiServer.java:579`).

| # | Control | Site | What it excludes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Loopback bind** | `LocalApiServer.java:582` — `this.app.start("127.0.0.1", bindPort)` | Every remote host. The address is a literal, not a setting: there is no configuration path to `0.0.0.0`. |
| 2 | **Host-header allowlist** | `setupHostValidation` (`:193-207`), predicate `isAllowedHost` (`:685`) | DNS rebinding. After a rebind the request is *same-origin* with the attacker's domain, so CORS no longer applies — but the attacker's domain is still in the `Host` header, and only `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1` are accepted. Applies to every method, including token-exempt GETs. |
| 3 | **MCP Origin validation** | `setupMcpOriginValidation` (`:238-241`) via `enforceLoopbackOrigin` (`:248`), predicate `isAllowedMcpOrigin` (`:295`) | A browser reaching `/mcp` or `/api/mcp/token`. Absent `Origin` is admitted (native MCP hosts are not browsers); a present `Origin` is parsed as a URI and its host component compared for equality, so `http://127.0.0.1.evil.com` does not pass. This is the MCP Streamable-HTTP spec's own MUST, and is deliberately independent of `prodMode`. |
| 4 | **CORS pinned to the shell origin** | `setupCors` (`:370-397`), `resolveAllowedOrigin` (`:708`) | A cross-origin page *reading* a response. In prod only the desktop origins (`tauri://localhost`, `http(s)://tauri.localhost`) are granted. CORS is not a request-blocker, which is why control 2 exists. |
| 5 | **Per-boot session token on mutating routes** | `setupSessionTokenEnforcement` (`:441`), route predicate `requiresSessionToken` (`:422-430`) | A foreign caller performing a mutation. Required on `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` **and on every method under `/api/chat/runs`** — the run family's prefix is `RunRoutes.PATH_PREFIX` (`RunRoutes.java:29`), read by the predicate rather than re-spelled, and matched as a prefix rather than enumerated, so a future read route under it inherits the requirement instead of silently shipping open. `OPTIONS` is exempt on every path (`:423-425`): a CORS preflight cannot carry the header, so demanding it there would break every browser call it precedes — control 4 answers preflights, and the token is then demanded on the actual request. The token is minted per Head boot (`HeadlessApp.java:364-365`) and delivered to the shell through the Tauri bridge; a restart mints a new one, so a stale client fails **closed** with 401. |

**`GET /api/mcp/token` is token-exempt by construction and that is correct.** It is how a legitimate
external MCP client obtains the token in the first place, so it cannot itself demand one. It is not
unguarded: controls 2 and 3 both apply to it (reviewed 2026-08-13; see the threat model's residual
read-path analysis). What it hands out is a credential that any same-user native process could
already read from the runtime manifest — i.e. the route gives away nothing that is inside the trust
boundary. The desktop shell never calls it.

**Token enforcement fails closed.** In prod mode with a null or blank session token, the server
refuses to install its filters and start, and raises a lifecycle reason code. Before 2026-09-02 this
branch logged `TOKEN_ENFORCEMENT_DISABLED` and continued serving with the one control that gates
mutation silently switched off. That was fail-open on the control that matters most, and the fact
that no shipped launch path could reach it (`HeadlessApp.java:364-365` pairs `prodMode` with
`generateSessionToken()`; dev-runner, jseval and ui-shot never set prod mode) made it *unreachable*,
not *safe* — a future launch path would have inherited a silent downgrade. Refusing to start is the
only behaviour whose failure is loud.

**The session token is authentication, not authorization.** It answers "may this caller reach the
API at all". Whether a specific action is approved is the trust lattice's separate `GateBehavior`
ceremony (`AUTO` / `INLINE_CONFIRM` / `TYPED_CONFIRM` / `DENY`). Holding the token satisfies neither
confirm gate, and clearing a confirm gate does not substitute for the token. Two independent layers,
by design.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- The posture is one document, so a reviewer can ask "what is inside the boundary" and get an
  answer, rather than reconstructing it from five filter methods.
- The failure mode of every control is explicit: 403 (Host / Origin), 401 (token), refuse-to-start
  (missing token in prod). None of them degrade silently.
- The accepted residual is written down, so a future reviewer does not spend the same afternoon
  rediscovering that a same-user process can read the token off disk.

**Negative (accepted)**

- **A same-user native process is fully trusted.** It can read the token from the runtime manifest
  and drive every API the shell can drive, including `justsearch_ingest`. This is not mitigated; it
  is the boundary.
- **The token is per-boot and in-memory.** There is no revocation, rotation or expiry short of a
  restart. Acceptable while a boot is the unit of session.
- **CORS' contribution depends on the browser enforcing it.** Control 2 is what actually blocks the
  rebinding case; control 4 is defense in depth on top of it.
- **Fail-closed can turn a misconfiguration into a non-starting app.** That is the intended
  trade: a Head that will not start is a bug report, a Head serving mutations without a token is a
  vulnerability nobody notices.

## Alternatives Considered

### Unix-socket / named-pipe transport instead of loopback TCP
Removes the browser as a reachable caller entirely — no port, no Host header, no CORS. **Rejected**
for now: the Tauri webview and the external MCP client inventory both speak HTTP over loopback, and
Windows named-pipe support across that inventory is unproven. It remains the strongest available
upgrade and is named as a reassess trigger below.

### OS-level per-caller authentication (peer credentials / process identity)
Verify the calling process rather than a shared secret. **Rejected** — it would not change the
boundary. Every caller worth admitting *and* every caller worth excluding runs as the same user, so
peer credentials cannot separate them. It would add machinery without moving the residual.

### Persist the token so clients survive a restart
Would spare external MCP clients a re-fetch after a Head restart. **Rejected** — the per-boot token
is what makes a stale client fail closed. Persisting it converts a self-healing failure into a
long-lived credential on disk for no benefit the manifest re-read does not already give.

### Keep token enforcement fail-open and rely on the launch path
The status quo before this ADR: the only production launch path always supplies a token, so the
fail-open branch is unreachable. **Rejected** — "unreachable today" is a property of one caller, not
of the code. The next launch path (a service wrapper, a test harness promoted to prod, an installer
variant) inherits a silent downgrade. See `docs/reference/contributing/agent-postmortems.md`
(`green-masked-destructive`) for the pattern.

## Reassess When

- **The API binds anything other than `127.0.0.1`.** Probe `adr-0046-loopback-bind-literal` fails
  and this ADR is void until re-derived — every control above assumes the network cannot reach the
  port.
- **A multi-user or shared-machine scenario appears on the roadmap.** "Same-user native process" is
  the whole boundary; it stops meaning anything the moment two users share a host.
- **Any token-bearing path becomes reachable from a browser** — a new route serving the token
  without the Origin check, or a shell that fetches it over HTTP instead of reading the manifest.
- **A transport with OS-level access control becomes viable** for the full caller inventory (see
  the first alternative), which would let the boundary shrink from "same user" to "named callers".
