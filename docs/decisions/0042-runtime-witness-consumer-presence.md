# ADR-0042: Live-registry witness — consumer-presence over the live ContributionRegistry

## Status

Accepted. Adds the **live-registry tier** of tempdoc 560 §4b/§5 (the witness), and resolves the four
§E.2.1 decisions that 564's "481 Pass-3" parked, with defensible defaults (recorded below so they are
auditable and reversible).

## Context — consumer-presence already has two static tiers

1. The **`consumer-presence`** discipline gate: a static referencer scan over
   `RegistrySnapshotExporter`'s snapshot — it proves a declaration *names* a consumer
   (`consumerCount >= 1`).
2. The **`runtime-witness`** discipline gate (already shipped, tempdoc 560 §5 "second half"): still
   static, but bidirectional for the **AGENT** channel — it cross-checks the declared agent consumers
   against `snapshot.witness.agentDelivered` (the op ids `AgentOperationEmitter` *would* deliver,
   computed from the **static** catalogs). It catches AGENT-channel over-claim / phantom.

Both tiers read **static catalogs**. Contributions composed into the live `ContributionRegistry` **at
runtime** — projected workflow ops (`core.workflow-*`, via `WorkflowOperationProjection`), MCP tools,
plugin contributions — are **absent from the static snapshot**, so *neither* static tier examines them.
This is the empirically-demonstrated "DR-D" blind spot (tempdoc 560 §11.6): `GET /api/registry/witness`
shows `core.workflow-demo-compose` live with `buildWitnessed=false` — live but invisible to the
build-time witness, **by construction** (§11.2/DR-A: the build-tier witness is structurally static and
cannot see runtime composition).

Today every runtime-composed contribution happens to carry a consumer (`Workflow` and `Prompt` make a
zero-consumer declaration unrepresentable in their constructors). The gap is that `Operation` and
`Resource` **permit** an empty consumer set (the `NonEmpty<ConsumerHook>` enforcement is deferred), so a
future runtime-composed op/resource with zero consumers would be a silent orphan no static tier catches.

## Decision

Add a **live-registry witness** (`live-witness`): a check that every **delivered** `ConsumerDeclaring`
contribution in the **live** `ContributionRegistry` (operation / resource / prompt) carries at least one
consumer. It reuses the existing consumer-presence merge — it is **not** a second/forked authority, and
it **complements** (does not replace) the static `runtime-witness` gate: same §5 keystone, the tier that
sees runtime composition. It runs at the only tier that observes runtime composition: a backend
**live-registry integration test** (`LiveWitnessTest`) over a registry composed exactly as
`SubstratePhase` composes it (`OperationCatalogComposition.installBaseCatalogs` + `installWorkflowOps`).
The check is `LiveWitness.orphanedDeliveries(live)` (in `app-services`, co-located with
`RegistrySnapshotExporter`), which reuses `RegistrySnapshotExporter.operationConsumerIds` (inline ∪
executor-derived) for operations and `SurfaceConsumerIndex` (inline ∪ surface-derived) for resources.
The authority is named in a register (`governance/live-witness.v1.json`) and its presence + wiring are
guarded by a register-integrity early-warning (`scripts/ci/check-live-witness.mjs`), mirroring the
tempdoc 575 in-flight-liveness pattern — **not** a new offline kernel gate (an offline gate cannot see
runtime composition, per DR-A).

### The four §E.2.1 decisions — resolved as defensible defaults

1. **Agent-consumer witness shape → attest at the DELIVERY SEAM, not consumption.** A contribution is
   "delivered" when it is composed into the live registry with its `ConsumerHook.Realized` consumer
   present. An agent tool's consumer is satisfied by being *bound into the live agent toolset*, **not**
   by the model invoking it. Delivery ≠ invocation; this keeps the witness deterministic and testable.

2. **Per-actor deadline policy → none; attested-at-compose, tier-keyed.** Lockstep core/FE/agent attest
   at boot; independent plugin/MCP attest on their `install(Installation)`. "Undelivered" means
   declared-but-never-composed — a live absence, not a wall-clock timeout. JustSearch has no
   uncoordinated consumers, so RFC-9745/k8s grace windows do not apply.

3. **`Promised.sliceId` / SliceCatalog referential-integrity → out of scope.** The witness governs
   **Realized** hooks only. (`ConsumerHook.Promised` was reverted — only `Realized` exists today — so
   this is forward-compatible: a future `Promised` graduation stays a separate substrate primitive.)

4. **Runtime traffic counter → delivery-PRESENCE, not a count primitive.** The witness asks "is this
   delivered contribution's consumer present in the live registry?", not "did a hook receive ≥1 delivery
   this session." It reuses the live registry (and `/api/registry/witness`), introducing **no** new
   recursive `RegistryEntry`-shaped `TrafficCounter` primitive (AHA / no-fork).

## Rationale

- **Right tier.** DR-A established the build-tier witness is structurally static. The only tier that
  observes runtime composition is a live-registry test; per `static-green ≠ live-working`, that is
  exactly where a runtime invariant must live.
- **No fork.** The verdict semantics (the consumer merge) are the *same* as the static
  `consumer-presence` gate; the live witness applies them over the live set. The authority is registered
  (575-style) so it cannot be silently deleted, and the register cross-references the static
  `runtime-witness` gate so the two tiers stay legible as one concern.
- **Closes DR-D at the root.** A runtime-composed contribution is now examined for consumer-presence
  even though it never enters the static snapshot.

## Rejects

- **An offline kernel discipline-gate for the live check.** It would read the tree, not a running
  registry, so it physically cannot see runtime-composed contributions (DR-A). The register-integrity
  early-warning + the live-registry test is the correct split.
- **Folding the live check into the existing static `runtime-witness` gate.** That gate is offline
  (reads a snapshot file) and AGENT-channel specific; the live check is a different tier (a backend
  test). Two tiers, one concern — kept legible via the register's `complements` cross-reference, not
  merged.
- **A `TrafficCounter` / delivery-count primitive** (decision 4 alt). Heavier, recursive, unneeded —
  presence, not count, is what the invariant requires.
- **Wall-clock delivery deadlines** (decision 2 alt). Calibrated for uncoordinated consumers JustSearch
  does not have.
- **Synthetic consumer hooks to make orphans "pass."** A consumer-less delivered op/resource is a defect
  to fix or explicitly exempt, never to paper over.

## What this changes in the substrate

- New: `LiveWitness` (app-services) + `LiveWitnessTest` (the teeth); `governance/live-witness.v1.json`
  (the authority register, with a `complements: runtime-witness` cross-reference + the four decisions);
  `scripts/ci/check-live-witness.mjs` (register-integrity early-warning). `RegistrySnapshotExporter`
  gains a public `operationConsumerIds(Operation)` (extracted from `buildOperationEntries`, reused by
  the live witness — behavior-preserving).
- The static `consumer-presence` and `runtime-witness` gates and the `contribution-surface` gate are
  unchanged.

## Future Agents Must Not

- **Re-implement the live consumer-presence check per-surface.** Derive from `LiveWitness`; it is the
  single live-registry authority (the register guards this).
- **Confuse `live-witness` with the static `runtime-witness` gate.** The latter is the static
  AGENT-channel delivery-consistency check; `live-witness` is the live-registry consumer-presence tier.
- **Promote the live witness to an offline kernel gate.** It must run at the live-registry tier (DR-A).
- **Add a `Promised`-hook witness here.** Promised graduation is a separate primitive (decision 3).
- **Silence an orphaned delivery by adding a synthetic consumer hook.** Fix the missing consumer, or add
  an explicit, reasoned exemption — never a no-op hook.

## Revisit When

- `ConsumerHook.Promised` is reintroduced (decision 3 reopens — SliceCatalog integrity).
- A real plugin/MCP ecosystem ships uncoordinated consumers (decision 2's deadline model reopens).
- The §4b uniform-all-kinds witness (unioning the core substrate catalogs into one live witness surface)
  is scoped — model it as a tempdoc 575 projection, not a fork.
