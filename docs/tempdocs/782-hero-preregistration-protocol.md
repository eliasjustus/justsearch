## §A. Purpose

One document that makes the hero run auditable before it is expensive: every rule that could
be bent after seeing results is written and frozen before any paid call. Precedent: the 624
relaunch pre-registration (adoption-only target, budget guard, honest-abort semantics) — this
protocol inherits that shape and adds what 624's post-mortem and the 767/774 leak history
taught.

## §B. Contents to draft (each becomes a frozen section)

1. **Design:** strata (enron-1k/10k, legal-1k; legal-10k EXCLUDED per decision 2 — the
   representation floor is 783's problem, not a claim), n=60/stratum, judge=sonnet,
   cheapest-first ordering, USD cap ~$300 with the 624-style guard + pre-registered abort.
2. **Validity rules decided blind:** the leak checks the probe history mandates (a
   measurement probe without pre-registered validity rules once reported its own leak as a
   win — agent-lessons 2026-07-22); identity gates; corpus-signature pins to the 781 v2
   commitments; single-cohort requirement; verified_tool_surface rate ≥ 0.9 (624 policy).
3. **Judge validity:** a pre-run judge-agreement spot-check (sonnet vs held-out human/founder
   adjudication on a small sample, 764's method) with a pre-registered agreement floor;
   below floor → the run does not start.
4. **At-capture instrumentation (771 item 3 lands here):** per-query rank-of-gold, span/
   evidence carriage, tool-call counts, and the READ-AMPLIFICATION after-measure — 765
   baselined agents re-Reading full files pre-flip; the hero captures the post-flip
   distribution for free. Also exhaustion/duration ledgers per 624.
5. **Claim grammar:** exactly what sentence(s) the run can promote, with confidence
   intervals (bootstrap over queries, reported alongside every headline number), and what
   verdicts are possible (accepted / adoption-only / rejected — 624's ladder). No public
   number leaves 623's founder-gated pipeline (decision 3).
6. **Spend + incident ledger format**, resume-safety rules, and the two-failed-relaunches
   stop rule (inherited from the 624 supervision spec).

## §C. Acceptance

- Protocol frozen (this doc's freeze commit named) BEFORE the first paid call; any later
  edit to frozen sections voids the run's claim eligibility.
- Both triggers verified at freeze time: installer artifact exists (760); 781 cohort
  fully certified incl. gold-selectivity.
- The run itself is a separate execution record (new tempdoc or 766 closing section) citing
  this protocol by commit.

## §D. Notes

- Founder-gated actions stay founder-gated: launching the paid run, publishing any number
  (623), and any cap increase.
- The protocol should be short enough to be read before every supervision shift; verbosity
  here is a validity risk, not thoroughness.

# §E. THE PROTOCOL (draft 2026-07-27 — **NOT FROZEN**)

> **Freeze mechanics.** This §E is the frozen artifact. It freezes when a founder-authorized
> commit (a) resolves every `PENDING-AT-FREEZE:` marker in §E.7, (b) records the freeze commit
> SHA in §E.0, and (c) verifies both triggers (760 installer artifact exists; 781 cohort
> `fully-certified`). Until then §E is a draft and **no paid call may be made**. After freeze,
> any edit to §E.1–§E.6 voids the run's claim eligibility; amendments made *before the first
> measured cell* follow 624's dated-amendment convention and must be appended, never inlined.

## §E.0 Freeze record — **FROZEN 2026-07-28**

**§E.1–§E.6 are FROZEN as of the commit that introduces this line** (the freeze commit; its short
SHA is recorded in §H once the commit exists — 624's convention, since a commit cannot contain its
own hash). **Any later edit to §E.1–§E.6 voids the run's claim eligibility.** The frozen sections
are: §E.1 Design, §E.2 Validity rules, §E.3 Scorer/judge validity, §E.4 At-capture
instrumentation, §E.5 Claim grammar, §E.6 Ledgers/resume/stop rules — plus §E.8, which is the
frozen qid selection this freeze commit materializes.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| freeze commit | the commit introducing this line (short SHA recorded in §H) |
| freeze timestamp (UTC) | 2026-07-28 |
| trigger 1 — 760 installer artifact | **SATISFIED** — `build-installer.yml` dispatch run `29914075529` (2026-07-22) is GREEN end-to-end; artifact `windows-installer` (`.github/workflows/build-installer.yml:268-278`), 259.9 MB, downloaded and PE-census-verified (177 PEs: 99 rehearsal-signed + timestamped, 78 vendor-signed untouched, zero NotSigned) — 760 §CI signing rehearsal campaign. **Honest scope:** this is a *rehearsal-signed CI artifact*, not a GA-released real-cert-signed installer; the GA cut and the cert/vendor decision remain owner-gated and are **not** 782 launch preconditions (§C requires only that the artifact exists). Actions retention is 7d, so the blob itself has expired — the durable evidence is 760's recorded census, and a fresh artifact is one `gh workflow run build-installer.yml --ref main` dispatch away with no release cut. |
| trigger 2 — 781 cohort `fully-certified` | **SATISFIED** — both members `status: "fully-certified"`, `structural_passed: true`, `fully_certified: true` in `scripts/jseval/781-corpora/<member>/structural-certification.v1.json`, committed by `6e3db1a6` (#311). Blobs: `en-email-enron-raw` `21c05563`, `en-legal-clerc` `73b08679`. All three hero cells carry `checks` 9/9 true and `scientific_gates` `closed_book`/`retrieval_calibration`/`union_recall`/`leak_floor` all `passed: true`. **Pointer correction (this freeze):** P2's original pointer to `member.v1.json` is wrong — that file carries no `status` key and its `remaining_gates` is pre-#311 residue still listing the four scientific gates. The machine authority is the certification file (`corpus_certify.py:815-817` reads `status == "fully-certified"` there); P2's check is hereby pinned to `structural-certification.v1.json`. |
| active claim policy at freeze | **`agent-utility-public-v3`** — `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json` (blob `1d6d4b41`), `status: "active"`, `unresolved: []`, ratified by squash `76185d82` (#310, 2026-07-28). It is the only `utility-claim-policy.*.json` with `status: "active"`; `utility-claim-policy.v1.json` is `superseded`. `required_strata` = §E.1 verbatim, cheapest-first, each `query_count: 20`, `seed_ids: [0,1,2]`, `requested_model: "sonnet"`. |
| launch authorization | founder-gated; recorded in §E.6 ledger, never here. **NOT GRANTED.** |
| launch eligibility | **BLOCKER-1 CLEARED by Amendment 1 (below).** Remaining pre-launch work is procedural, not a decision: the §E.2 P3 sonnet closed-book measurement (§H FINDING-2 → campaign-plan Step 0b), the §E.3 derivability audit, the §E.2 P4 leak checks, and founder launch authorization. |

### Amendment 1 — 2026-07-28 (pre-launch, **zero measured cells**)

624's dated-amendment convention: a frozen section may take **appended, dated** amendments until
the first measured cell; after that, any change voids claim eligibility (§E.2 R5). Zero cells are
measured, so this amendment is in-window. It is appended here, never inlined into §E.1–§E.6.

| field | value |
|---|---|
| amendment | **1** |
| date | 2026-07-28 |
| decided by | orchestrator, under the founder's 2026-07-28 blanket delegation |
| measured cells at amendment | **0** |
| change | `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json` → `required_schema_strata.known_schemas`: `["1_hop","2_hop"]` → `["1_hop"]` |
| unchanged | every `thresholds` value; `required_strata`; every `requirements` key (incl. `schema_strata_reported: true`); **`require_all_present` stays `true`** — now satisfiable and still load-bearing, since the `1_hop` breakdown must still be reported and an absent one still refuses the record |
| amendment commit | `4c0fd7bf` |
| resolves | §E.7 row 12 / §H BLOCKER-1 |

**Rationale, recorded verbatim in the policy's `policy_changelog`:** *"Amendment 1 (pre-launch,
zero cells measured): known_schemas [1_hop,2_hop]→[1_hop] — corpus-description correction per 782
§E.7 row 12 / BLOCKER-1; thresholds untouched; decided under founder delegation of 2026-07-28"*.

This is a **corpus-description correction, not a threshold or bar change.** The certified 781 v2
gold sets — and all 707 English cells — are 100 % `1_hop` by construction; the v3-DRAFT's `2_hop`
entry described a multi-schema cohort that was never built. Requiring the presence of a schema
absent from the corpus is a spec error, and the refusal gate surfaced it **pre-spend**, exactly as
intended (§G.1's stated residual limit). No `§E.1–§E.6` text changed; the amendment moves a policy
value that §E.2 R3 deliberately reads *from the policy* rather than restating.

## §E.1 Design (frozen section 1)

**Authority: founder decision 2 (766 §G). Nothing in this section may be re-optimized.**

- **Strata (3, all `verbose`):**

  | # | stratum | dataset | corpus_member | size |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | enron-1k | `mixed/en-email-enron-raw-1k-verbose` | `en-email-enron-raw` | 1000 |
  | 2 | enron-10k | `mixed/en-email-enron-raw-10k-verbose` | `en-email-enron-raw` | 10000 |
  | 3 | legal-1k | `mixed/en-legal-clerc-1k-verbose` | `en-legal-clerc` | 1000 |

- **legal-10k is EXCLUDED** — not in `required_strata`, not run, not reported, not a control.
  Reason (771 §E M5): true retrieval floor 0.82–0.90 there, so a delta measures corpus
  difficulty, not the tool. Adding it back is a founder decision, not a supervision-shift one.
- **Model:** sonnet-class for both arms (`requested_model: "sonnet"`); every cell must resolve
  to one `resolved_provider_model`. haiku is **not** run in this campaign.
- **Arms:** A = file tools only; B = A + JustSearch MCP. Primary estimand `addition_b`, ITT
  (resource-exhaustion-as-failure) primary, per-protocol secondary.
- **n = 60 paired observations per stratum** = 20 committed qids × 3 seeds `{0,1,2}` × 2 arms
  = **120 cells/stratum, 360 cells total**. The v2 cells carry 50 queries each; the 20 are
  selected by a deterministic committed rule, never by hand. ✅ **RESOLVED at freeze — see §E.8.**
  The rule is `--max-queries 20` over the committed, certified `queries.json` in its committed
  order, i.e. **qids `q0001`–`q0020`**. This is not a style preference: it is the only selection
  that survives the certification digest check (`agent_utility_inspect.py:1794-1824` hashes the
  WHOLE queries file's bytes and truncates only the sample rows, so any *rewritten* subset file —
  including a PRNG sample — fails `query_gold_sha256` with "query-and-gold digest disagrees").
  624 set the same precedent (`retained_query_indices: [0..19]`,
  `624-run-2026-07-21-relaunch/calibration-email-enron-raw-1k-verbose.json`).
- **Ordering: cheapest-first** — enron-1k → enron-10k → legal-1k. (624 confirmatory amendment 1:
  the max-extrapolation guard over-projects when the most expensive stratum calibrates first;
  the fix is order, not cap.)
- **Budget:** hard cap **$300 USD**, running guard `python scripts/jseval/step2-budget-guard.py
  --cap 300` (max-extrapolation over `cost_estimate_usd` of known calibrations) before each
  stratum launch. **Binding limit is USD, never wall-clock** (765 §E: 69/86 wall-clock kills lost
  their cost receipt; USD kills retain them).
  **CALIBRATION-TIME (procedure frozen here, number derived at run time — 624's precedent, which
  also set `--max-budget` from fresh calibrations rather than pre-registering a number):** per-cell
  `max_budget` USD and `concurrency` come from the *fresh sonnet* `utility-calibrate` for each
  stratum, run on the campaign day against the live backend. **The frozen part is the derivation
  rule, not the value:**
  - `concurrency` — taken from the calibration file's `concurrency` key, which `utility-run` reads
    and overrides the CLI flag with (`commands/utility.py:358`). Calibration is invoked at the
    campaign's target concurrency (`--concurrency 6`, 624's value; the calibration pilot runs *at*
    it so the estimate is not a single-threaded extrapolation).
  - `max_budget` — `ceil2(1.6 × p95_per_cell_cost_usd_at_sonnet)` from the same calibration, floored
    at `$0.50` (624's haiku value) and **capped at `$2.00`**; `ceil2` = round up to cents. The 1.6
    headroom and the floor/cap are frozen now so the number cannot be re-chosen after seeing a
    stratum's first cells. If a stratum's derived value would exceed `$2.00`, that is a **stop**,
    not a raise: record it and escalate (a cap raise is founder-gated, §E.6).
  - The derived pair is written into the run dir's `spend-ledger.md` at the phase boundary *before*
    that stratum's launch, and into `campaign-plan.md`'s per-cell record — never adjusted after.
- **No partial-value ladder.** `required_strata_exact` means a 2-stratum record cannot promote,
  so a projected over-cap → **ABORT the whole campaign and report** (624 confirmatory §Budget).

## §E.2 Validity rules decided blind (frozen section 2)

Every rule below is evaluable mechanically, before any result is interpreted. **P-rules are
pre-launch (fail → do not launch); R-rules are per-run/at-compose (fail → the affected stratum
is void, see §E.6).**

**P0 — policy identity.** ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-07-28 by the §G ratification.** The active policy is
`scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json` (`policy_id: agent-utility-public-v3`,
`status: "active"`), and it declares exactly the §E.1 three strata with `requested_model: "sonnet"`,
`query_count: 20`, `seed_ids: [0,1,2]` — see §G for the verbatim block. The pre-launch check is:
that file is the one `utility-claim-policy.*.json` with `status: "active"`, its `unresolved` is `[]`,
and its `required_strata` match §E.1. `utility-claim-policy.v1.json` is now
`status: "superseded"` (it is history, not the operative policy) and the v3 DRAFT file — whose
matrix contradicted decision 2 — is deleted.

**P1 — corpus_signature pins (v2 cohort, 781 §E.2).** Each stratum's computed
`corpus_signature` must equal, byte for byte:

| stratum | `corpus_signature` | `query_gold_sha256` (verbose) |
|---|---|---|
| enron-1k | `3391fc9781c6dafc4881322337558810b739b1a1d55a4eac5e1f035bec18cff7` | `1138c58c809859a5fb8e4dcd6fe54845d67834e474d7d49be7a2144db3584352` |
| enron-10k | `6a80af3b5bdbb59d578eedfd00a4c35815ffcf07450afce2de73d4dd818399cb` | `1138c58c809859a5fb8e4dcd6fe54845d67834e474d7d49be7a2144db3584352` |
| legal-1k | `6df707031abcd296773a0bf8c6a7750bb0b8704ce4ab4035105cf88b8df01fae` | `2797469a5f80aa8881553323880cd910dd83b621dabd935e7d577337f0f3f565` |

Read from `scripts/jseval/781-corpora/<member>/structural-certification.v1.json`; asserted
against the composed record's `strata[*].corpus.corpus_signature`. A mismatch is fatal — never
"the corpus moved, re-pin the protocol". ✅ **RE-CONFIRMED at freeze 2026-07-28 by primary re-read
(not assumption)** of the certifications committed by `6e3db1a6` (#311) — blobs `21c05563`
(`en-email-enron-raw`) and `73b08679` (`en-legal-clerc`). All six values above match byte for byte;
781 §E.4's scientific pass did not move them, as predicted. Also re-read at the same time and
recorded here so P2 is evaluable from one place: every hero cell's `query_count` is **50** (the
committed gold set; the campaign measures the first 20 — §E.8), and every hero cell's
`field_selectivity` gate is `passed: true` with `max_field_separability: 0` ≤ `native_base_rate: 0`
on `n_fields_compared: 2`, worst field `text` (method
`field-presence-null-calibrated-separability`) — the title-presence leak class (774 §J.7) is closed
at zero separability on all three strata.

**P2 — gold-selectivity certification.** Every stratum's member must be `fully-certified`
(`781-corpora/<member>/member.v1.json`), and the `field_selectivity` gate must be PASS on
**every field × every cell** with `max_field_separability <= native_base_rate`. A
`structurally-certified` member is NOT sufficient — that is 781's current state, and the whole
point of the trigger. This is the direct guard against the title-presence leak class (774 §J.7).

**P3 — closed-book at hero tier.** Closed-book accuracy measured **at sonnet** on each stratum
must be `0.000` (781 §C). Any non-zero value means the answers are derivable without the corpus
→ do not launch. ✅ **The two-number conflict is RESOLVED (§G, 2026-07-28):** the ratified
`maximum_closed_book_accuracy` is `0.1`, and it is a post-hoc failure **CEILING** enforced by the
`closed_book_at_hero_tier` gate — it does **not** relax this P-rule. The pre-launch bar stays
`0.000` at sonnet. Read it as: below 0.000 to launch; above 0.1 voids the benefit headline for
that stratum even if it somehow launched.

**P4 — probe-self-leak checks (the 2026-07-22 lesson: a probe without pre-registered validity
rules reported its own leak as a win).** All four run pre-launch over committed artifacts, output
committed to the run dir:
  1. **Arm symmetry** — `prompt_template_hash` and the instruction text are byte-identical
     across arms A and B; the arms differ *only* by MCP tool availability. Any arm-specific
     prompt content voids the design.
  2. **No gold text in the prompt** — for every selected qid, the question text contains neither
     the gold answer string nor any gold doc id, and no gold-only *field* (title, author, entity)
     is injected into either arm's context. This is the exact shape of the discarded
     title-prepend arm.
  3. **Answer-key path isolation** — the agents' `--add-dir` resolves to the exploded
     `corpus-dir` only; `qrels`, `fabricated-queries.json`, `fabricated-meta.json` and
     `commitment.v1.json` are outside every readable root. Verified by path check pre-launch and
     by `leak_suspect_tool_calls == []` on every cell at compose.
  4. **Shipped-config parity** — `captured_search_config` equals the shipped product default
     cohort (post-775 flip). No eval-only boost, field, or limit. We measure the product users
     get (766 §G decision 1).

**P5 — scorer/judge floor.** §E.3 must be green. Below floor → the run does not start.

**R1 — identity gates (per run + at compose).** One `search_config_cohort_key`, one
`agent_cohort_key`, one `cli_version` for the whole campaign, `git_dirty: false`, clean committed
tree, corpus-dir derivation check enforced in root mode (624 §Identity hardening), exposure
identity carried through compose.

**R2 — `verified_tool_surface`** (policy `agent-utility-public-v2` semantics, carried into v3):
rate ≥ **0.9**, exactly one observed hash equal to the declared cohort hash, **any single
different hash is fatal regardless of rate**, a missing hash after retry+fallback is a capture
miss that lowers the rate only.

**R3 — data-quality thresholds** (from the active policy `thresholds`, not restated as new
numbers): `minimum_seeds` 3, `minimum_paired_observations` 54, `maximum_exclusion_rate` 0.15,
`minimum_paired_retention` 0.7, `minimum_excluded_jaccard` 0.5, `significance_alpha` 0.05,
`minimum_adoption_rate` 0.9. Plus `no_leak_suspect_cells`, `contamination_class:
private-synthetic`.

**R4 — single cohort, one compose.** All three strata compose in ONE
`utility-recompose` invocation. No retroactive stratum substitution; a voided stratum is rerun
under the SAME cohort window or the campaign records `rejected` (624 relaunch §Analysis plan).

**R5 — nothing changes after the first measured cell.** Strata, n, qid list, arms, model,
thresholds, α, estimand, cap. Any post-hoc change → the run is not claim-eligible, full stop.

## §E.3 Scorer / judge validity + pre-registered agreement floor (frozen section 3)

**Scorer identity first.** 764 §E established that the production scorer is `substring_scorer`
(gold string ⊆ answer), **not** an LLM judge — and that its full-string requirement was the only
thing neutralizing the v1 naming leak. So the audit's shape depends on what is active at the
freeze commit. ✅ **READ AT THE FREEZE COMMIT, verbatim:** the wired scorer is
**`substring_scorer`** — `scorer=substring_scorer()` at
`scripts/jseval/jseval/agent_utility_inspect.py:1512`, defined at `:1454-1460` (delegates to
`_score_answer(target.text, completion)`; gold string ⊆ answer, with the abstention/error branch
returning `"I"`). The task's declared `judge_kind` default is `"substring-em"`
(`agent_utility_inspect.py:1483`). **No LLM judge is active in the primary scoring path.**

**Operational reading of the two-layer scorer (this is the frozen §F.3 semantics).** The primary
scorer for the hero campaign is `substring_scorer` (EM). The hybrid **EM→local-LLM judge overlay**
is a *post-hoc, zero-paid-API* re-score applied to the already-completed logs —
`jseval utility-judge` → `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_judge.py:141 judge_logs(...)`, which keeps
EM as a high-precision auto-PASS and only sends EM-misses to the judge, stamping
`kind="hybrid-em-llm"` when it judged anything and `"substring-em"` when it did not (`:197`). The
overlay **never changes which cells were run or what they cost** — it is attached at compose via
`utility-recompose --judge-overlay`. **Judge-family control stays intact:** the cross-family grader
panel (`utility_judge.py:691 judge_cross_family`, with `cohens_kappa` `:290`, `bootstrap_kappa_ci`
`:313`, `is_degenerate_pe` `:273`, `rater_agreement_report` `:356`) is the calibration instrument,
and the local model does the bulk pass (`utility-judge-local-swap-smoketest` proves the swap), so
no paid judge call is required for the overlay. Because the *primary* scorer at freeze is
`substring_scorer`, the branch that runs pre-launch is the **derivability audit** below, not the
agreement spot-check (§E.7 row 10). Then:

- **If `substring_scorer` is active** — run the *derivability* audit instead of an agreement
  audit: for every selected qid, assert the gold answer string is **not** derivable from any
  token in the question or from any entity name in the corpus metadata (the
  `corpus_generate.py:320-323` naming-leak class, 764 §E). Floor: **0 derivable qids**. Any hit →
  the qid is replaced from the committed pool *before* launch, and the replacement is recorded.
- **If an LLM judge is active** — run the pre-registered agreement spot-check below.

**Agreement spot-check (method: 764 §A.2 — zero-cost first, paid only for tiebreaks).**

- **Sample:** 40 completed cells, stratified: ≥10 per stratum, balanced across arms A/B, and
  balanced across scored-correct / scored-incorrect. Drawn with a seed fixed here
  (`random.Random(2026)`), from a **pre-hero pilot or banked cells** — never from the hero cells.
- **Reference:** founder adjudication (held-out human), rubric held fixed — the rubric is
  measured, never redesigned in this audit (764 §B).
- **Floors, both required:** exact agreement **≥ 0.95** (≥38/40) **AND** at most **1**
  disagreement in the direction that favours arm B. An arm-asymmetric error pattern is the
  failure mode that manufactures a win, so it carries the tighter floor.
- **Below either floor → the run does not start.** No remediation-then-relaunch inside the
  campaign; a failed audit sends the scorer back to design and this section is re-frozen.
- Cost: the local model (`ai_activate`, ~11s load) does the bulk pass at zero API cost; paid
  sonnet is used only to break local-vs-original disagreements (764 §D).

## §E.4 At-capture instrumentation (frozen section 4) — 771 item 3 lands here

Everything below is captured **during** the hero cells; none of it costs an extra paid call.
Raw tool content is never committed — digests only (`_tool_result_digest_entry`,
`agent_utility_inspect.py:934`).

**Per search call** (`state.metadata["tool_result_digests"][*]`, 768 D6):
`ordered_doc_ids`, `scores`, `gold_rank` (honest `None` when gold is absent — **never a
fabricated 0**), `delivered_tier`, `delivered_fields`, `component_bytes`.

**Per cell:** `tool_calls`, `tool_call_sequence`, `tool_calls_blocked`,
`disallowed_tool_calls`, `leak_suspect_tool_calls`, `mcp_tools_offered`,
`observed_mcp_tool_surface_hash`, `usage`, `cost_usd`, `unique_tokens`, `turns`,
`usage_truncated`.

**Derived at compose (committed as JSON in the run dir):**

1. **Rank-of-gold distribution** per stratum × query: median/p90 `gold_rank`, and the
   share of search calls with `gold_rank is None`.
2. **Evidence/span carriage**: share of B cells whose delivered payload carried the
   answer-bearing span (post-775 flip); `delivered_tier` census.
3. **Read-amplification after-measure (771 item 3).** From `tool_call_sequence`, per B cell:
   (a) count of filesystem `Read` calls occurring after the first `justsearch_search` call;
   (b) the share of those Reads whose target is **not** in any preceding `ordered_doc_ids`;
   (c) `mcp_call_share`. **Pre-flip reference (765 §E / 770 §A.2, different cohort, model and
   corpora): `mcp_call_share` ≈ 0.5, and 50.3% of post-search Reads (N=862) targeted documents
   search never returned.** This after-measure is **pre-registered as DESCRIPTIVE ONLY** — it is
   not a comparison, not a claim, and no delta against the pre-flip reference may be promoted.
   Naming this before launch is what stops "we cut re-reads by X%" from appearing afterwards.
4. **Exhaustion ledger** per stratum × arm: `n_attempted / n_completed / n_exhausted /
   n_excluded / n_pending`, `per_arm_loss`, plus the 765 §E taxonomy split —
   **USD-exhausted (receipts retained)** vs **wall-clock-cancelled (cost null by design)**.
   Null costs are **segmented, never imputed** (757 §D.2).
5. **Duration ledger** per stratum × arm: median + p95 wall-clock with an explicit censoring
   flag; efficiency intervals **fail closed** wherever with-tool truncation exists — that is a
   pre-registered accepted outcome, not a defect (624 relaunch §Registered target).

## §E.5 Claim grammar (frozen section 5)

**Verdict ladder (624's, unchanged).** The composed record's `claim_verdict` is the verdict; no
human re-reads it into something better.

| verdict | when | what may be said |
|---|---|---|
| `accepted` / outcome `benefit` | all gates pass **and** efficiency intervals are available and direction-checked | the accuracy/efficiency sentence in the templates below |
| `accepted` / outcome `adoption-only` | all gates pass, efficiency intervals unavailable (truncation) | the adoption sentence only — **no numeric benefit language** |
| `rejected` / `inconclusive` | any gate fails | nothing. The measured numbers stay in this tempdoc as history |

**Confidence-interval convention (applies to every headline number).** Report a **95% cluster
bootstrap CI over queries**: resample **qids with replacement, carrying each qid's 3 seed
replicates as a cluster** (seeds within a qid are not independent), 10,000 resamples, BCa,
`random.Random(2026)`. Report it *beside* the exact-McNemar p (α = 0.05) — both, always. If the
two disagree, both are reported and the disagreement is stated; it is never resolved post hoc.

**Power honesty line, mandatory beside every null (764 §E).** At n = 60 pairs, exact McNemar has
power 0.89 for Δ = 0.20 (discordant rate 0.25) and is underpowered below Δ ≈ 0.15 (n@80%: 92 for
Δ = 0.15, 208 for Δ = 0.10). A null is therefore reported as **"no effect detected at n = 60"**,
never as "no effect".

**Triple reporting (v3 `triple_reporting_semantics`).** The ITT number is the headline; the
per-protocol accuracy **and** the completion rate are published beside it; the per-cell budget is
stated explicitly.

**Forbidden headlines** (any occurrence makes the statement non-promotable):
- raw absolute accuracy of a weak arm presented alone;
- any ratio off a near-zero base — an infinite/undefined multiplier must be reframed as
  completion-rescue or absolute lift;
- adoption rate presented as benefit;
- a null stratum as a headline;
- **anything about legal-10k** (excluded per §E.1);
- **any read-amplification delta** (§E.4 item 3 is descriptive only);
- any number without its CI and its estimand named.

**Publication.** No number leaves the 623 founder-gated pipeline (766 §G decision 3): immutable
publication manifest + owner-selected pointer. Drafting a public sentence is not publishing it;
publishing is founder-only, per action.

## §E.6 Spend + incident ledger, resume-safety, stop rules (frozen section 6)

**Run directory:** `scripts/jseval/782-run-<YYYY-MM-DD>-hero/` — per-stratum
`utility-comparison.v1.json`, the single combined cross-corpus record, all calibrations, the
chain script, the §E.2 pre-launch check outputs, the §E.4 derived JSONs, and both ledgers below.

**Spend ledger** (`spend-ledger.md`, appended at every phase boundary — before each calibration,
before each stratum launch, after each stratum completes):

| ts (UTC) | phase | stratum | planned $ | actual $ | cumulative $ | guard projection $ | headroom vs $300 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Actuals reconcile against the per-run records' ledgers at close; an unreconciled gap is reported,
not smoothed (765 §E found a ~+8% SDK price-table skew — report the skew, don't pick a number).

**Incident ledger** (`incident-ledger.md` — 624's confirmatory night logged six):

| id | ts (UTC) | what fired | cohort-affecting? | remedy | $ consumed | stratum voided? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Every guard that fires gets a row, including guards that fired correctly. A fired guard is
evidence, not an obstacle — never hand-patch an identity to get past one.

**Resume-safety.**
- Resume uses Inspect `eval_set` durable per-cell resume keyed on `sample_id`, into the **same**
  `log_dir` with **byte-identical task args**. A changed task arg creates a new run and **splits
  the cohort** — treat it as a failed relaunch, not a resume.
- After any resume, re-assert R1 (single `search_config_cohort_key` / `agent_cohort_key` /
  `cli_version`) before continuing.
- Calibrations are never adopted across git SHAs or CLI versions (624 incident #5: a banked
  calibration from another SHA split the cohort and the recompose refused).
- The harness window runs with `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`; `cli_version` is recorded at start and
  re-checked at every phase boundary. A mid-campaign CLI change voids every cell after it (624
  incident #6).

**Stop rules (all mandatory; each is a full stop, not a judgment call).**
1. **Two-failed-relaunches** — a stratum may be relaunched at most **twice** inside the cohort
   window. On the second failed relaunch of **any** stratum the campaign STOPS and records
   `rejected`. No third attempt, no stratum substitution, no cohort-window extension.
2. **Guard over-cap** — projected total > $300 → ABORT the campaign (§E.1: no partial ladder).
3. **Pre-launch failure** — any P0–P5 check red → do not launch.
4. **Fatal identity** — a different observed tool-surface hash (R2), or a mid-campaign cohort
   split that a resume cannot repair → stop and record.
5. **Post-first-cell change request** — any request to change a frozen parameter mid-campaign →
   stop, record, escalate to the founder. Not an amendment; the amendment window closed.

**Founder-gated, never agent-initiated:** launch authorization, any cap increase, any
publication, any change to §E.1's design parameters, policy ratification.

**The execution record is a separate document** (§C): a new tempdoc or a 766 closing section that
cites this protocol **by its §E.0 freeze commit SHA**. Results are never written into §E.1–§E.6 —
that would be editing a frozen section.

## §E.7 PENDING-AT-FREEZE index (the mechanical freeze checklist) — **CLOSED OUT 2026-07-28**

| # | item | section | disposition at freeze |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | freeze commit SHA + timestamp | §E.0 | **FILLED** — timestamp 2026-07-28; SHA recorded in §H per 624's "the commit introducing this line" convention |
| 2 | 760 installer artifact identity | §E.0 | **FILLED** — `build-installer.yml` run `29914075529`, artifact `windows-installer`, PE-census-verified (760 §CI signing rehearsal campaign) |
| 3 | 781 members `fully-certified` (not `structurally-certified`) | §E.0 / P2 | **FILLED** — both members `status: "fully-certified"` / `fully_certified: true` in `structural-certification.v1.json` (`6e3db1a6`, #311); P2's pointer corrected from `member.v1.json` (which has no `status` and stale `remaining_gates`) to the certification file |
| 4 | ~~ratified `policy_id` + `required_strata` re-pinned to §E.1~~ ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-28 (§G)** — `agent-utility-public-v3`, `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json`, strata = §E.1 verbatim | P0 | **FILLED** — merge commit `76185d82` (#310) recorded in §E.0 |
| 5 | re-confirm the three `corpus_signature` pins are unmoved by 781 §E.4 | P1 | **FILLED** — all six values (3 signatures + 3 gold digests) re-read and byte-identical to §E.2's pinned table; see P1 |
| 6 | ~~ratified `maximum_closed_book_accuracy`~~ ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-28 (§G)** — `0.1` as a post-hoc failure CEILING; P3's pre-launch bar stays `0.000` at sonnet | P3 | **FILLED** |
| 7 | the 20-qid list per stratum + sha256 + the deterministic selection rule | §E.1 | **FILLED** — §E.8 (rule + the three lists + both digests + schema census) |
| 8 | per-cell `max_budget` USD from fresh **sonnet** calibrations; concurrency | §E.1 | **CALIBRATION-TIME** — the derivation rule, floor and cap are frozen in §E.1; the number comes from the campaign-day sonnet calibration. 624's precedent set `--max-budget` the same way. |
| 9 | active scorer identity at the freeze commit (`substring_scorer` vs LLM judge), recorded `file:line` | §E.3 | **FILLED** — `substring_scorer`, `agent_utility_inspect.py:1512` (def `:1454-1460`), `judge_kind` default `"substring-em"` `:1483` |
| 10 | which §E.3 branch runs (derivability audit vs agreement spot-check) — follows item 9 | §E.3 | **FILLED** — the **derivability audit** branch (row 9 resolved to `substring_scorer`) |
| 11 | run-directory date suffix | §E.6 | **CALIBRATION-TIME** (launch-day) — `scripts/jseval/782-run-<YYYY-MM-DD>-hero/`; the *pattern* is frozen, only the launch date is unknown until the founder authorizes |
| 12 | **NEW at freeze — `known_schemas` coverage vs the hero query sets** | P-rule (new) / §E.5 | ✅ **AMENDED 2026-07-28** — §E.0 Amendment 1 (commit `4c0fd7bf`) narrows `known_schemas` to `["1_hop"]`; `require_all_present` stays `true`. Was a founder decision; taken under the 2026-07-28 blanket delegation. See §H BLOCKER-1. |

**11 of 11 original rows disposed: 9 FILLED, 2 CALIBRATION-TIME** (rows 8 and 11 — each is a value
624's precedent also set at run time; the freeze pins the *procedure and guard*, not the number).
Row 12 is new: the freeze's own mechanical check found a pre-launch blocker that §G.1 predicted
would be findable from the committed qid list. Nothing in this table is a judgment call at
supervision time.

## §E.8 The frozen 20-qid selection (frozen section 7 — §E.7 row 7)

**Selection rule (mechanical, no PRNG, no hand-picking).** For each stratum: take the committed,
certified `queries.json` in its committed order and keep the **first 20 rows**, i.e. `--max-queries
20` on `jseval utility-run`. qids are the rows' own `query_family_id` values, `q0001`–`q0020`;
Inspect sample ids are `{condition}|q{index}` with `index` 0-based, so `A|q0`–`A|q19` and
`B|q0`–`B|q19` per seed.

**Why this rule and not a seeded sample.** `run_utility_eval` computes
`query_identity.sha256` over the **entire queries file's bytes** and only afterwards truncates
`rows` to `max_queries` (`scripts/jseval/jseval/agent_utility_inspect.py:1796-1812`), then refuses
the run when that digest differs from the certification's `query_gold_sha256` (`:1818-1824`,
`"corpus_certification rejected: query-and-gold digest disagrees with queries"`). A seeded sample
would have to be written to a new file, whose bytes differ, so it would fail the certified-identity
check — the certification would have to be re-issued to bless a subset. Truncation is therefore the
only certification-preserving selection, and it is fully deterministic. 624 used the same shape
(`retained_query_indices: [0..19]`, 0 dropped).

**The lists.** Identical qid labels across all three strata by construction (positional ids), which
is why the label digest alone is not an identity — the per-stratum **content** digest below is the
binding pin.

| stratum | dataset | qids | `qid_list_sha256` | `selected_query_sha256` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| enron-1k | `mixed/en-email-enron-raw-1k-verbose` | `q0001`…`q0020` | `7b7856e8d8d0f3ce4ca8499798ce93ac1e5aec58633fc03fe514d7f3853c5b5b` | `27aba99517718d0fe1cecab16232d563a6ed8ee11d7ba0bed547c5183a75d065` |
| enron-10k | `mixed/en-email-enron-raw-10k-verbose` | `q0001`…`q0020` | `7b7856e8d8d0f3ce4ca8499798ce93ac1e5aec58633fc03fe514d7f3853c5b5b` | `27aba99517718d0fe1cecab16232d563a6ed8ee11d7ba0bed547c5183a75d065` |
| legal-1k | `mixed/en-legal-clerc-1k-verbose` | `q0001`…`q0020` | `7b7856e8d8d0f3ce4ca8499798ce93ac1e5aec58633fc03fe514d7f3853c5b5b` | `316f80bb6e0144aad11c8ebddfe660ee1881afde4b6b862d889f0a44fea96cb2` |

- `qid_list_sha256` = `sha256(utf8("q0001\n…\nq0020\n"))`.
- `selected_query_sha256` = `sha256(utf8(json.dumps([{qid, query, answer, question_type}, …],
  separators=(",",":"))))` over the 20 selected rows in order, read from
  `scripts/jseval/781-corpora/<member>/<size>-verbose/fabricated-queries.json`.
- The two enron strata share a digest **correctly**: they share one gold query set (§E.2 P1 pins the
  same `query_gold_sha256` `1138c58c…` for both). legal-1k differs, as its gold digest
  (`2797469a…`) does.
- Cross-checked at freeze: the first 20 rows of the **materialized** `queries.json` match these on
  `query`/`answer`/`question_type`/`query_family_id` at both visible materializations
  (`tmp/781-v2-datasets/mixed/…` and the `datasets/mixed/…` junction) — MATCH on all three strata.
- Reproduce: `python scripts/jseval/782-hero/preflight.py` (prints both digests per stratum).

**Schema-coverage picture at freeze (§G.1's residual limit, evaluated).**

| stratum | selected 20 | full committed 50 | policy `known_schemas` at freeze | projection at freeze | after Amendment 1 (`["1_hop"]`) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| enron-1k | `1_hop`: 20 | `1_hop`: 50 | `["1_hop","2_hop"]` | **WILL FAIL** — `2_hop` missing | **PASSES** |
| enron-10k | `1_hop`: 20 | `1_hop`: 50 | `["1_hop","2_hop"]` | **WILL FAIL** — `2_hop` missing | **PASSES** |
| legal-1k | `1_hop`: 20 | `1_hop`: 50 | `["1_hop","2_hop"]` | **WILL FAIL** — `2_hop` missing | **PASSES** |

Every stratum is single-schema. This is **not** an artifact of the 20-of-50 truncation — the full
committed 50-query gold set of every one of the eight 781 v2 cells is 100 % `1_hop`, and so is
every 707 English cell. `2_hop` exists only in older corpora (`635-corpora/synth-multihop-prose-v2`,
`624-corpora/battlefield-en-v1`, `707-corpora/de-miracl/gold-short-natural`), none of which is a
hero stratum. Recorded here at freeze so compose-time cannot surprise; escalated as §H BLOCKER-1.

## §G Claim policy v3 — RATIFIED 2026-07-28 (closes §E.7 items 4 and 6)

**Authority.** Founder decision 2 (766 §G); the ratification act itself was delegated to the
orchestrator on 2026-07-28 with a fixed composition rule — **v3-DRAFT's structural machinery +
v1's (`agent-utility-public-v2`'s) numeric thresholds VERBATIM + founder-decision-2 strata**.
No threshold was tuned and no stratum was chosen by an agent.

**File.** `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json` — `policy_id: agent-utility-public-v3`,
`status: active`. `required_strata` are exactly §E.1, in §E.1's cheapest-first order:

| # | `stratum_id` |
|---|---|
| 1 | `en-email-enron-raw\|mixed/en-email-enron-raw-1k-verbose\|1000\|verbose\|sonnet` |
| 2 | `en-email-enron-raw\|mixed/en-email-enron-raw-10k-verbose\|10000\|verbose\|sonnet` |
| 3 | `en-legal-clerc\|mixed/en-legal-clerc-1k-verbose\|1000\|verbose\|sonnet` |

each `query_count: 20`, `seed_ids: [0,1,2]`. **legal-10k is absent** — item 4's contradiction
(the draft declared legal-10k×sonnet + legal-1k×sonnet + legal-10k×haiku) is resolved in favour
of decision 2. Item 6 is resolved by keeping the draft's `maximum_closed_book_accuracy: 0.1` as a
post-hoc failure **CEILING**; it does not relax P3, whose pre-launch bar stays 0.000 at sonnet.

**Selector change.** `utility_claim_policy.policy_path()` now returns the v3 file. The v2
document (`utility-claim-policy.v1.json`) is `status: "superseded"` +
`superseded_by: "agent-utility-public-v3"`, retained as history and as the byte-source the
no-tuning test compares against. `utility-claim-policy.v3-DRAFT.json` is DELETED, and its
`v3_draft_policy_path`/`load_v3_draft_policy` accessors are gone; the only live references that
moved were `scripts/docs/gen-public-agent-utility.mjs` (+ its test), which also stopped hardcoding
"four-stratum … 1k and 10k" and now renders the stratum count from the policy.

**Three additive requirements are now wired, not decorative.** `completion_triple_reported`,
`closed_book_at_hero_tier` and `schema_strata_reported` were declared by the draft but would have
failed the `supported_policy_requirements` gate closed, making every record unpromotable. Each is
now a real conditional gate (fires only when a policy declares it, so records under v1/v2 project
byte-identically):

- `completion_triple_reported` — every ITT stratum must carry `n_per_protocol_pairs` and a per-arm
  `completion_rate` (`estimands.completion.strata[*].by_arm[*]`).
- `closed_book_at_hero_tier` — every stratum's 707 certification snapshot must carry a measured
  `scientific_gates.closed_book.observed.closed_book_accuracy` at or below the ceiling, with a
  named measurement model.
- `schema_strata_reported` — every composed measured cell must publish a `schema_stratified.by_stratum`
  covering both known schemas. Cells are located by their own `primary_arm` marker, not by joining
  on a dataset key (the measured key is the canonical slug `beir/fixture` while the ITT stratum's
  `corpus` is `fixture` — a join there would silently miss).

**Defect found and fixed by that third gate (768 D4 round-trip).** `sanitize_observation` wrote
`question_type` and `_OBSERVATION_KEYS` accepted it, but `read_evidence` never restored it — so
every *offline replay* recomposed with no schema tag and silently dropped `schema_stratified`,
contradicting the write-side comment's own promise. Repaired at
`scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_evidence.py` (`read_evidence`). This mattered directly: the
publication/replay path is how a hero record gets published.

**Test evidence.** Full jseval suite: **2520 passed, 2 skipped** (`python -m pytest tests/`).
`node scripts/docs/gen-public-agent-utility.test.mjs` → OK (98 assertions); `--check` in sync after
regenerating README/RESEARCH/`docs/reference/benchmarks/agent-utility.md`. Deliberate pin changes:

| pin | change | why it is the new truth |
|---|---|---|
| `test_checked_in_policy_is_active_confirmatory_four_stratum` | renamed `…_is_ratified_v3_three_stratum_sonnet_hero`; asserts v3 id + the §E.1 ordered stratum list | the four-stratum haiku matrix is superseded by decision 2 |
| `test_checked_in_active_policy_evaluates_surface_via_rate_branch` | `agent-utility-public-v2` → `…-v3` | same rate semantics, new carrier (§E.2 R2) |
| `test_supported_requirements_match_schema_properties_exactly` | `required` now compared against a new explicit `MANDATORY_REQUIREMENTS` constant, still an exact set equality | supported ≠ mandatory once requirements became additive; keeps the superseded v2 document schema-valid without back-dating keys into it |
| `test_historical_fixture_semantic_digest_repinned_after_624_itt_change` | `ed81f79b…` → `c3f98ebd…` | 4th occurrence of the documented policy-identity re-pin class; the sole-mover proof is now the runnable `test_v3_repin_is_policy_identity_only_prior_pin_reproduces` (see §G.1), not prose |

New test: `test_v3_ratification_tuned_no_threshold_and_dropped_legal_10k` — literally compares v3's
thresholds against the superseded v2 file on every shared key, asserts the only divergence is the
additive `maximum_closed_book_accuracy`, and asserts 3 strata / all sonnet / no legal-10k. That
makes "no threshold was tuned during ratification" a mechanical property rather than a claim.

## §G.1 Independent-review response (2026-07-28)

An independent refute-first review of the ratification commit returned SHIP-WITH-FIXES. The
ratification content was confirmed sound (thresholds re-diffed verbatim vs v1; strata verbatim vs
§E.1; conditional gates confirmed key-present-and-truthy; old-policy records reproduced
byte-identically). Six items landed as a follow-up commit.

**1. A false verification recipe I wrote — corrected.** §G originally claimed the prior digest pin
`ed81f79b…` reproduces "when the SUPERSEDED v2 document is passed as the policy". It does not: the
committed superseded document yields `d32dffba…`, because *this commit's own* `status` flip to
`superseded` plus the added `superseded_by` change the policy hash the verdict carries. The
conclusion (policy identity is the sole mover) was true, but the recipe would have sent the next
auditor chasing a phantom regression. The claim is now a runnable test rather than prose —
`test_v3_repin_is_policy_identity_only_prior_pin_reproduces` reconstructs the *pre-ratification*
v2 shape from the committed file (pop `superseded_by`, restore `status: "active"`) and asserts
`ed81f79b…`. Lesson worth keeping: a prose verification recipe that nobody re-runs is exactly where
a phantom hides — pin it or drop it.

**2. Negative tests for the three new gates.** Only the pass branch was covered, so a gate inverted
to always-True would have shipped green (a passing gate and an absent gate are indistinguishable
from `accepted is True`). Added four refusal tests, each asserting the SPECIFIC gate name surfaces:
`completion_triple_reported` (strip `estimands.completion`), `schema_strata_reported` (strip the
breakdown, asserting the missing-schema payload), and two for `closed_book_at_hero_tier` (evidence
removed; accuracy above the ceiling). **Honest isolation note:** the closed-book measurement rides
the 707 snapshot, which is cross-validated against its own embedded certificate, so any mutation of
it *also* trips `corpus_certification_complete`. That co-failure is asserted rather than glossed,
and the gate's independent work is proved by a before/after on the same gate plus its observed
payload — the first draft of these tests claimed an isolation they did not have, which would have
been a second false recipe.

**3. Sweep residue in the operator-facing sections.** §E.2 P0 still told the operator to verify
`utility-claim-policy.v1.json` had `status: "active"` (now false) — repointed at the v3 file with a
status-based check. §E.2 P3 now records the ceiling-vs-0.000 resolution inline. §E.7 rows 4 and 6
are struck through and marked CLOSED, with the running count (9 of 11 open) stated. Stale comment at
`gen-public-agent-utility.test.mjs` corrected.

**4. Canonical doc.** `docs/reference/benchmarks/agent-utility.md` now states the three
promotion-blocking reporting requirements in its verdict contract. Docs regen pair run
(`llmstxt-generate` + `skills-sync`); neither produced a diff.

**5. Generator robustness.** `gen-public-agent-utility.mjs` no longer hardcodes a version-numbered
policy filename — the same defect class its own test comment says was fixed for the policy ID. It
now selects the single `utility-claim-policy.*.json` with `status: "active"` and FAILS generation
when zero or two are active, or when `unresolved` is non-empty, rather than rendering the sentence
"is active and fully resolved" over a policy that is neither. Covered by a new fail-closed scenario
(generator test: 98 → 110 assertions).

**6. Pre-campaign landmine — CLOSED (this was the one that could have cost money).** The §G
follow-up below was fixed rather than deferred, because a collapsed schema could have made a PAID
hero record unpromotable for a reporting artefact. Two composer defects, in
`scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_comparison.py`:

- `_stratified_breakdown` dropped a label whose paired observations collapsed. It now emits an
  explicit null entry (`available: false`, `n_paired_observations: 0`, collapse reason) — opt-in via
  `emit_null_strata`, passed only by the schema axis, so the corpus axis (§T.4) composes
  byte-identically to before.
- The deeper cause, found only by writing the test: the label vocabulary was derived from the
  *surviving pairs*, so a fully collapsed label had no label left to report and vanished anyway. The
  null-emitting path now takes its vocabulary from the whole `qid → label` map. **This is why the
  first fix looked correct and was not** — the drop happened one level above where it appeared to.
- `_default_schema_stratify` returned `None` for a single-schema cell, conflating "one schema
  measured" with "schema coverage never computed". It now returns `None` only when NO query carries
  a `question_type` — the genuine pre-768 byte-identity contract, still asserted.

The pre-existing contract test asserting a single-schema cell adds no key was flipped deliberately
(`test_single_schema_cell_still_reports_its_one_schema_but_untagged_adds_no_key`): v3's
`require_all_present` needs those two cases distinguishable. New tests:
`test_collapsed_schema_reports_an_honest_null_never_a_dropped_key` (the exact collapsed case) and
`test_null_strata_emission_is_opt_in_so_the_corpus_axis_is_unchanged`.

**Residual limit, stated rather than hidden.** A schema absent from a cell's *query set* entirely
still fails `schema_strata_reported`, because the composer has no access to the policy's
`known_schemas` vocabulary and cannot invent a null for a schema it never saw. That failure is
correct under `require_all_present`, and it is detectable pre-launch from the committed 20-qid list
(§E.7 row 7) rather than at compose time on a paid record — which is the property that mattered.

## §H Freeze execution record (2026-07-28)

**Freeze commit:** `docs(782): FREEZE the hero pre-registration protocol` — short SHA
**`28c2cced`** on `worktree-agent-a4fa71b45c297d4ac` — the commit that froze §E.1–§E.6 + §E.8 and
introduced this §H. Its SHA is recorded by the immediately following one-line commit rather than by
amending it into itself: an `--amend` that injects a SHA changes that very SHA, so the injected
value names an unreachable object. (624's "reference the commit introducing this line" convention,
resolved the non-regressive way. The freeze is `28c2cced`; the recording commit is not part of the
frozen content and does not touch §E.1–§E.6.) Every §E.7 row is disposed (§E.7); §E.1–§E.6
plus §E.8 are frozen; §E.0 records the two triggers and the active policy. The campaign driver
prepared by the same commit lives at `scripts/jseval/782-hero/` (`campaign-plan.md`,
`preflight.py`, `cells.v1.json`) — **dry artifacts only: no paid call was made, no backend was
started, no dataset or certification was touched.**

Two findings the freeze's own mechanical checks produced. Both are recorded rather than worked
around; neither is an agent's to decide.

### BLOCKER-1 — `schema_strata_reported` cannot pass on any hero stratum — **CLEARED 2026-07-28 by Amendment 1**

> **Resolution (appended, the finding below is left intact as the record of what was found).**
> Resolution 1 was taken: `known_schemas` → `["1_hop"]`, commit `4c0fd7bf`, under the founder's
> 2026-07-28 blanket delegation. `require_all_present` stays `true`. See §E.0 Amendment 1 for the
> verbatim rationale. `preflight.py` now reports **36 PASS / 0 FAIL / 6 PENDING**. Digest
> consequence: the 5th occurrence of the documented policy-identity re-pin class

**What.** v3 declares `required_schema_strata.known_schemas: ["1_hop","2_hop"]` with
`require_all_present: true` (`scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json`). The gate
(`scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:517-542`) requires every known schema to appear in
each measured cell's `schema_stratified.by_stratum`. **All three hero strata's gold query sets are
100 % `1_hop`** — verified over the whole committed 50-query set of all eight 781 v2 cells, not just
the selected 20 (§E.8). So `2_hop` is absent from the breakdown on every cell, the gate fails, and
`claim_verdict` cannot be `accepted` — **the full $300 would buy an unpromotable record.**

**Why it wasn't caught earlier.** §G.1 item 6 fixed the *composer* so a schema whose pairs collapse
is reported as an honest null instead of vanishing, and stated the residual limit exactly: a schema
absent from the query set entirely still fails, "detectable pre-launch from the committed 20-qid
list (§E.7 row 7)". Row 7 is this freeze. The prediction held and the detector fired — before spend,
which is the property that mattered.

**Resolutions, both founder-gated (§E.6: policy ratification and §E.1 design changes are
founder-only).** Recorded without a recommendation *(resolution 1 was subsequently taken — see the
resolution note above)*:

1. **Amend `known_schemas` to `["1_hop"]`** in the v3 policy. Cheapest; honest (the hero corpora
   genuinely measure one schema); costs the 2-hop reporting axis 768 D4 introduced, and re-opens the
   policy-identity digest re-pin class (5th occurrence — `test_historical_fixture_semantic_digest_*`).
   Note this is a *policy* change after §E.0's freeze, not an edit to a frozen §E section.
2. **Add `2_hop` queries to the three hero corpora.** Preserves the reporting axis; requires
   regenerating the gold sets → new `query_gold_sha256` and (if `corpus.jsonl` changes) new
   `corpus_signature` → **full 781 re-certification** → §E.2 P1's pinned table must be re-issued,
   which means re-freezing §E.2. Expensive and slow.

Until one lands, §E.0's `launch eligibility` stays **BLOCKED**. `preflight.py` fails closed on this
item by design. *(Resolution 1 landed 2026-07-28; the item now passes.)*

### FINDING-2 — the committed closed-book measurement is at haiku; P3's bar is sonnet

`scientific_gates.closed_book.observed` in both 781 certifications reads
`{"closed_book_accuracy": 0, "n_queries": 50, "model": "haiku", "date": "2026-07-27",
"method": "closed-book-slot-guess"}`. Two different bars read it:

- The **policy gate** `closed_book_at_hero_tier`
  (`utility_claim_policy.py:478-515`) requires only a numeric accuracy ≤ `0.1` and a **non-empty
  model name** — it does **not** check the measurement tier. The committed haiku measurement
  therefore **passes the gate as it stands**.
- **§E.2 P3**, this protocol's own pre-launch rule, requires `0.000` measured **at sonnet**. That
  measurement does not exist. P3 is *not* satisfied by committed artifacts.

P3 is frozen and is the stricter bar, so a **fresh sonnet closed-book measurement on all three
strata is a mandatory pre-launch step** — it is Step 0b in `campaign-plan.md`. It is a real (small)
paid step: 3 strata × 50 queries, no tools, no corpus. Its cost is charged to the $300 cap and
recorded in the spend ledger like any other phase. It does not change the certification files; it is
attached as the campaign's own P3 evidence in the run dir. **This is not a licence to relax P3** —
if the sonnet measurement is anything other than `0.000`, §E.6 stop rule 3 applies.

### Pointer corrections made at freeze (operator-facing, pre-freeze so not frozen-section edits)

- **P2's certification pointer** moved from `member.v1.json` to `structural-certification.v1.json`.
  `member.v1.json` carries no `status` key at all and its `remaining_gates` still lists all four
  scientific gates — pre-#311 residue. The machine authority is
  `corpus_certify.py:815-817`, which reads `status == "fully-certified"` from the certification
  file. An operator following the original pointer would have concluded the trigger was unmet.
  (Logged to the observations inbox as a repo-side residue to sweep separately.)
- **§E.1's selection rule** is now the mechanically-forced truncation rule rather than an abstract
  "deterministic committed rule", with the certification-digest reason stated inline so a future
  agent cannot "improve" it into a seeded sample and silently break certified identity.

## §I Campaign log — run 2026-07-28 (appended post-freeze; dated history, amendments per §E.0 convention)

Authoritative evidence: `scripts/jseval/782-run-2026-07-28-hero/` (records, calibrations, judge
overlays, closed-book, leak-checks, §E.4 derived JSONs, both ledgers, window-1 records). Register
entry: F-043. This section is the narrative index, not a second authority.

**Window 1 (morning):** s1 void run (mixed-model guard poisoned 120/120 cells — the CLI's
background-haiku calls; the frozen plan had dropped 624's `--agent-env` mitigation) → stop rule 5
invoked → **Amendment 2** (uniform `--agent-env ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5` +
`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5`; max_budget re-derived $0.80 by the frozen clamp rule
on the measured censored p95). s1/s2/s3 then completed comparable:true, judge overlays real
(out-of-band llama on 8081 through the Head /v1 proxy after diagnosing the eval-mode
`llm=True` silent no-op; polarity pre-checked both ways). **Step-5 compose FAILED CLOSED:**
`agent_cohort_key` split — the run dir lived inside the tracked tree, so `source_git_state`
drifted between strata (untracked 24→35→46) and `git_dirty` was true throughout (§E.2 R1
violated; the step-g between-strata re-assertion was not executed — owned in the incident
ledger). Unrepairable in-place (identity is baked; never hand-patch). Window-1 spend ~$130.

**Window 2 (afternoon):** identical frozen parameters; run dir relocated to gitignored `tmp/`
(ignored paths never enter the untracked fingerprint), calibrations reused (same git_sha
bea1ac37 + CLI 2.1.220, 624 precedent), R1 porcelain-0 asserted mechanically before EVERY
stratum launch. Two externally-induced incidents, both fail-closed with $0-to-small waste and
both root-caused (serve backend killed as a harness-tracked task mid-s1 → all long-running
processes now run detached; s2 pre-cell stray-root abort → the leak guard correctly refused a
dataDir still carrying s1's watched root; purged via `DELETE /api/indexing/roots`,
deletedJobs=1001). s1/s2/s3 completed comparable:true, identity clean (untracked 0, dirty
false), ONE cohort. Judge overlays ×3 clean (flips 1/0/4, agreement 0.887–0.984,
call_failures 0). **THE COMPOSE SUCCEEDED** — `combined/utility-comparison-cross-corpus.v1.json`,
semantic_digest `e2bb70c3…`. Window-2 spend ~$148; campaign total ~$278 of the $300 cap.

**Verdict as recorded:** `rejected / inconclusive / addition_b`; all three strata
`adoption-only`; 29/30 gates pass. **FREEZE DEFECT #2 (escalated, not patched):** the sole
failing gate `corpus_certification_complete` demands `cert.query_count == cell.query_count`
(`utility_claim_policy.py:414-423`) — the certifications certify the 50-query committed set,
the frozen design runs the 20-qid subset; 50 ≠ 20 always. Same class as BLOCKER-1, reachable
only at compose. Code-certain counterfactual (`utility_claim_policy.py:852-867`):
**accepted / adoption-only**. Founder decision requested: policy v4 with a subset-aware
certification gate (keyed on the frozen `selected_query_sha256` in `cells.v1.json`) + an
offline re-compose ($0, no re-measurement, no new cells). Until then the record stands as
rejected — the verdict is not re-read into something better.

**Measured (95% CI beside exact-McNemar p; power line: no effect detected at n=60/stratum):**
enron-1k Δacc −0.1964 [−0.375, −0.018] p=0.063; enron-10k −0.1304 p=0.146; legal-1k +0.0222
p=1.0. Window-1 signs identical (−0.154 / −0.093 / +0.022). Adoption rate 1.0; tool surface
verified 180/180 single hash; zero leak-suspect cells. Honest headline: the sonnet agent
reliably adopts the tool; the addition arm shows no accuracy benefit and is point-negative on
enron at this budget. Note the designed-in conservative asymmetry: B-arm cells exhaust the
$0.80 budget more often than A (10k: 12/60 vs 4/60) under `resource-exhaustion-as-failure`.

**Publication:** nothing here publishes; 623 pipeline remains founder-only per §E.5.

## §J Policy v4 re-compose (2026-07-28, founder-authorized)

**Founder authorization (verbatim, 2026-07-28):**

> firstly i would be up for upgrading the rule, but i think we shouldnt rerun today

Scope granted: the rule upgrade **and** a $0 OFFLINE re-compose of the existing window-2
evidence. Scope withheld: any re-measurement. **No new paid cell was run; total campaign spend
is unchanged at ~$278.** Publication (623) remains founder-only per §E.5 and is not touched here.

### J.1 The defect

`corpus_certification_complete` compared `cert.query_count == cell.query_count` **exactly**
(`scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:418` under v3). The 781 structural
certifications certify the **50-query committed gold set**; the frozen §E.1 design measures the
pre-registered **20-qid leading prefix** (`--max-queries 20`, §E.8). 50 ≠ 20 on every stratum,
so **no run under the frozen design could ever pass this gate** — while `query_gold_sha256`,
the identity that actually chains the certified queries, matched on all three strata all along.
A count comparison was standing in for a subset-identity check. Same defect class as BLOCKER-1
(caught at freeze); this one was reachable only at compose, on paid evidence.

### J.2 The gate design (policy v4, `agent-utility-public-v4`)

v4 is **v3 verbatim** — every threshold, every required stratum, every requirement, every
semantics block — plus ONE additive requirement, `certified_query_subset`. No threshold was
tuned; no stratum changed; no bar was relaxed. `utility-claim-policy.v3.json` flips to
`status: "superseded"` with `superseded_by: "agent-utility-public-v4"`, mirroring exactly how
v3 superseded v2 (`utility-claim-policy.v1.json`).

Like every v3 additive gate, the branch is **conditional**: it fires only when the selected
policy declares the requirement, so a record evaluated under v1/v2/v3 projects a byte-identical
verdict.

| Element | `file:line` |
|---|---|
| Requirement registered (`certified_query_subset`) | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:50` |
| Active-policy pointer → v4 | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:83-85` |
| Directly-superseded (v3) accessors | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:108-122` |
| `_derived_query_subset_identity` (record-side digest) | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:189-228` |
| `_certified_query_subset_ok` (the three-legged check) | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:231-260` |
| Conditional wiring inside the gate | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:514-557` |
| The gate emission itself (shape unchanged) | `scripts/jseval/jseval/utility_claim_policy.py:552-557` |
| Policy document (semantics + per-stratum `qid_list_sha256`) | `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v4.json` |
| Schema (`qid_list_sha256`, requirement, semantics block) | `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v1.schema.json:34-35,80,85` |
| v3 supersede stamp | `scripts/jseval/utility-claim-policy.v3.json:5-6` |
| Preflight accepts the frozen policy **or its declared successor** | `scripts/jseval/782-hero/preflight.py:78-117` |

**The rule.** With `certified_query_subset` declared, `corpus_certification_complete` passes iff
all of:

- **(a)** `cert.query_gold_sha256 == cell.query_identity.sha256` — unchanged. The FULL committed
  gold file still chains: the harness hashes the whole queries file's bytes and truncates only
  the sample rows, so a rewritten subset file fails here.
- **(b)** `cell.query_count <= cert.query_count`. A run claiming MORE queries than the
  certification covers is not a subset and is refused regardless of any declared digest.
- **(c)** the cell's **derived** subset identity equals this policy's **pre-registered**
  `required_strata[*].qid_list_sha256` for that `stratum_id`.

All other equality checks (dataset / member / size / query_variant / corpus_signature / snapshot
cross-validation) are untouched. **A full-count run (`cert.query_count == cell.query_count`)
short-circuits to the v1/v2/v3 branch verbatim**, so no historical verdict moves and a full run
needs no subset identity.

**What the derived identity is, and why this one.** The composed record carries **no** subset
hash — verified, not assumed: `selected_query_sha256` / `qid_list_sha256` appear nowhere in
`combined/utility-comparison-cross-corpus.v1.json`, and `utility_recompose` /
`agent_utility_inspect` emit neither. What the record *does* carry is
`campaign_identity.expected_cells` — already load-bearing for `itt_strata_derived` and
`source_identity_complete`, so keying on it is a **projection of the record's one selection
authority, not a second one**. Each entry is `"<condition>|<seed>|<qid>"`, and the harness mints
`qid = f"q{i}"` with `i` a **0-based ordinal** into the committed file truncated in committed
order (`agent_utility_inspect.py:1497-1505`: `Sample(id=f"{c}|q{i}")` over `rows[:max_queries]`).
The gate requires those ordinals to be the leading prefix `{0 … n−1}` with `n == query_count`
— the only certification-preserving selection, since any other subset would need its own gold
file and would break (a) — then digests the canonical 1-based labels `q0001…q{n:04d}` with the
**same recipe** that froze `qid_list_sha256` pre-launch (`782-hero/preflight.py:44-58`:
`sha256(utf8("\n".join(labels) + "\n"))`).

That recipe binds the gate to the **pre-registered** value rather than to a number derived today
from the record under judgement: the three strata's derived digests all reproduce
`7b7856e8d8d0f3ce4ca8499798ce93ac1e5aec58633fc03fe514d7f3853c5b5b`, copied verbatim from the
frozen `scripts/jseval/782-hero/cells.v1.json` §E.8 block. A test reads both files and compares
them, so a drift in either fails
(`test_checked_in_v4_policy_pins_the_frozen_782_subset_digests`).

The sibling `selected_query_sha256` is deliberately **not** gated here: no query text survives
into the composed record, so a post-hoc verdict cannot verify it. It remains the PRE-LAUNCH
content pin, asserted by `782-hero/preflight.py:172-186` against the committed gold cell before
any cell is paid for. Pinning a digest the gate cannot check would be decoration.

**Fail-closed, with no permissive default.** A record whose `expected_cells` are absent,
malformed, non-`q<digits>`, not a leading prefix, or of a length other than `query_count` has
**no derivable subset identity and FAILS** — as does a stratum with no pre-registered
`qid_list_sha256`. Four refusal branches are exercised by name
(`scripts/jseval/tests/test_utility_claim_policy.py:504`, `:517`, `:529`, `:548`), beside the
acceptance case (`:481`), the inertness proof (`:562`) and the frozen-digest cross-read
(`:592`).

**Frozen artifacts untouched.** `scripts/jseval/782-hero/cells.v1.json` and `campaign-plan.md`
still name `agent-utility-public-v3` and are **left unchanged** — they are the freeze record, and
§E.2 R5 makes any post-first-cell edit to them void claim eligibility. The chain is expressed
where it belongs instead: in `superseded_by`, which `preflight.py` now walks.

### J.3 Re-compose and assertion results

Same frozen Step-5 invocation as the campaign (identical log dirs + judge overlays,
`--contamination-class private-synthetic --confidence-tier C`), with v4 active, into
`scripts/jseval/782-run-2026-07-28-hero/combined-v4/`.

Control run first (**interrogate-results**): re-composing the same inputs with v3 still active
reproduced the committed record's `semantic_digest e2bb70c3…` and differed from the committed
file in `composed_at` alone — so the re-compose path is deterministic and any v4 difference is
attributable to the policy, not to drift in the harness.

**Re-composed verdict** (`combined-v4/utility-comparison-cross-corpus.v1.json`,
`semantic_digest c5a75457b264e0cfdecf5ab1ac552d3430a93300f3241766b9c72a49be1560bb`):

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "accepted": true,
  "outcome": "adoption-only",
  "arm": "addition_b",
  "strata": "all_required",
  "policy_id": "agent-utility-public-v4",
  "policy_hash": "d0c0d1ab9e621b545635bbadf70d9a1f53494ffa312e0aa8829112c2f8e48d39",
  "policy_status": "active",
  "unresolved": [],
  "reasons": []
}
```

Assertions, all machine-checked against the committed v3-scored record:

- **`corpus_certification_complete` passed.** It is the **only** gate whose value changed:
  `30/30` gates pass, `reasons: []`, and the gate-name set is identical between the two records
  (0 regressions, exactly 1 newly-passing gate).
- **The counterfactual held exactly.** `accepted / adoption-only`, per-stratum outcomes
  `adoption-only` on all three strata — precisely what the incident ledger predicted from
  `utility_claim_policy.py:852-867` without re-running.
- **Measured numbers are byte-identical.** A recursive diff of the two records reports **10
  differing nodes, ALL under `/claim_verdict`, `/semantic_digest`, `/composed_at` — zero
  elsewhere**. `measured`, `estimands`, `cohort`, `comparability`, `tool_call_assertions`,
  `coverage`, `corpora`, `conditions`, `outcome_rule`, `external_baselines`, `seed_count`,
  `confidence_tier` and `statistical_alpha` each compare equal as canonical JSON. Every headline
  delta in §I stands unchanged: enron-1k −0.1964, enron-10k −0.1304, legal-1k +0.0222, adoption
  1.0, surface verified 180/180.

**The v3-scored record at `scripts/jseval/782-run-2026-07-28-hero/combined/` remains committed
unchanged as dated history** — it is what the campaign produced under the policy in force at the
time, and it is not re-scored, edited, or replaced. `combined-v4/` sits beside it as the
founder-authorized offline re-compose, and the honest headline is unchanged by either: the sonnet
agent adopts the JustSearch MCP tool at rate 1.0 when offered, with **no measurable accuracy
benefit** and point-negative deltas on enron at n=60/stratum. `adoption-only` is a promotion
class, not a benefit claim — v4's `triple_reporting_semantics` still forbids
adoption-rate-as-benefit.

### J.4 Verification

- `test_utility_claim_policy.py` + `test_utility_evidence.py`: 124 passed.
- Full jseval suite: **2535 passed, 2 skipped, 1 failed** — the sole failure is the known
  `test_percentile_within_bounds` flake under full-suite load; it passes in isolation (7 passed).
- `gen-public-agent-utility.test.mjs`: OK (110 assertions); generator re-run and `--check` in sync
  (README / RESEARCH / benchmarks doc now name `agent-utility-public-v4`).
- `782-hero/preflight.py`: **36 PASS / 0 FAIL / 6 PENDING** — identical to the freeze result.
- Historical-projection byte-identity: `test_v4_repin_is_policy_identity_only_prior_pin_reproduces`
  reconstructs the v3 document in its pre-supersede shape and reproduces the v3-era pin
  `88e98a93…` exactly; the pre-amendment pin `c3f98ebd…` and the v2 pin `ed81f79b…` still
  reproduce from their own reconstructions. The active-policy fixture digest re-pins to
  `e3c3c9fd…` (6th occurrence of the same policy-identity re-pin class).

## §J.5 Addendum 2026-07-29 — claim policy v5 exists; this record stands as dated history

Appended post-hoc under the §E.0 convention. **Nothing in §I or §J is re-scored, edited or
replaced, and no cell was measured.** Written here only so a reader arriving at §J does not take
`agent-utility-public-v4` to be the active policy.

**What changed upstream.** Tempdoc 791 (campaign-v2 charter) axis 4 landed on 2026-07-29:
`agent-utility-public-v5` is now the ACTIVE claim policy (v4 verbatim + the additive
`question_level_primary` requirement), and v4 is `status: superseded`. v5 makes the QUESTION the
unit of analysis for the accuracy outcome — a paired sign-flip permutation over per-question mean
deltas and a question-cluster bootstrap interval — because the CELL-level exact McNemar reported
throughout §I counts a question's 3 seed replicates as 3 independent observations and so
understates `p`. The cell-level numbers stay reported, labelled descriptive.

**This record is not restated under v5.** `combined/` (v3-scored) and `combined-v4/` (the
founder-authorized offline re-compose) remain committed exactly as they are. A $0 offline
re-evaluation under v5 was run to report what would change, and is recorded in tempdoc 791, not
here; its result is `accepted / adoption-only`, 31/31 gates, `reasons []` — **unchanged**, because
`adoption-only` is an adoption-rate promotion class that never rested on significance. A control
re-compose under the pre-supersede v4 document reproduced this record's `semantic_digest
c5a75457…` exactly, which is what makes that attribution sound.

**The §I p-values remain what they were, and remain cell-level.** Read them as descriptive. On the
question-level primary, no stratum in this cohort clears α = 0.05 under either test; the
disagreement that motivated v5 (raw-EM window-2 enron-1k: cell-level 0.0446 vs question-level
0.1358) is a scoring-tier apart from this record's judge-overlaid numbers, and tempdoc 791
documents the reconciliation cell-for-cell.

**Both defects in §H/§J.1 are now $0 to find in advance.** `jseval utility-policy-dryrun` replays a
frozen design against a policy before the freeze commit; run against the real
`782-hero/cells.v1.json` it reports BLOCKER-1 and FREEZE DEFECT #2 as `structurally-impossible`,
per stratum, with the exact diagnosis each originally took a launch and a compose to surface.
Those two replays are committed regression tests (`tests/test_utility_policy_dryrun.py`).
