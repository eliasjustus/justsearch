# 617 - Full auto-update: decisions before design (374 G1 deep-dive)

> **Implementation update (2026-07-31).** The decision-scoping text below is
> retained as dated history. The implemented design supersedes its earlier
> assumption that `tauri-plugin-updater` belongs only to a future silent tier.
> JustSearch now uses the plugin as an authenticated download verifier while

> launching the verified NSIS installer through a witnessed Windows process.
> See §7 onward for the implemented contract and remaining release gates.

> What this document is. The **decision-scoping** doc for full auto-update — the deep-dive

> rationale *"useless with a single-digit user count who downloads fresh each time —
> revisit after there's real adoption."* **That rationale is now lifted: the product is
> ready for these considerations.** This doc does NOT re-derive what 374 already settled;
> it (a) records what's already decided, (b) maps the adjacent concerns to their owners,

> begins.** Verify dated claims against `main`.
>
> **Headline conclusion (2026-06-20):** full (silent) auto-update is **gated on code signing**.
> The *signing-independent spine* (detection + forward-only migration + feed/channel plumbing)

> lands. See §4.0 for the gating model and the locked decisions.

## 1. What 374 already settled (do not re-derive)

374's gap register did real research here. Treat these as **inputs**, not open questions:

- **Mechanism leaning**: `tauri-plugin-updater`. 374 G1/Tier-3: *"auto-updater with hosted
  manifest + Ed25519 keypair. `tauri-plugin-updater` ties the signing cert from G4 to updates."*
- **Dependency chain**: **G4 (code signing) → G1 (updater).** 374 calls the signing pipeline
  *"already drop-in ready (2026-04-24 dry-run) — add the real PFX env var the day it's bought."*
  The Ed25519 *update* keypair is distinct from the Authenticode cert; G1 needs both.
- **Channels (G2)**: researched and considered low-risk — *"`tauri-plugin-updater` does
  SemVer-aware version comparison"* and alpha/beta/rc/stable prerelease channels *"already
  Just Work with `tauri-plugin-updater`'s default"* (beta users get betas; stable users only
  get stable).
- **Version SoT**: `gradle.properties` → propagated by `scripts/ci/sync-version.ps1`
  (`-RequireReleaseSemver` enforces release SemVer). Drift is the manual-sync risk.
- **Release feed**: `build-installer.yml` attaches the installer to a GitHub Release on a
  `v*` tag (mechanism landed 2026-04-24; no release cut yet; `/releases/latest` undefined).
- **Distribution-format decisions already closed**: NSIS chosen; **MSIX / Microsoft Store
  rejected** (ADR-0024, *"too much friction for an indie project at this stage"*); MSI is
  G10/Tier-4; macOS/Linux is G8/Tier-4.

## 2. Adjacency map — who owns each related concern

The "is this already solved?" audit (2026-06-20), so nothing gets silently re-scoped:

| Concern | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Auto-updater | designed, deferred (now un-deferred) | **374 G1** (this doc) |
| Code signing / SmartScreen | designed, drop-in ready, **not bought** | 374 G4 |
| Release channels (alpha/beta/stable) | researched | 374 G2 |
| Versioning / SoT | shipped (manual sync) | 374 G2 / `sync-version.ps1` |
| Release feed / "latest" pointer | mechanism shipped, no cut | 374 G3 / tempdoc 409 |
| Uninstall / data-cleanup | partly shipped | 374 G5 |
| Component-independent *versioning* | shipped (models/llama/ORT) | 381 / ADR-0024 |
| SQLite state migration | shipped, mature | `SqliteQueueMigrationOps` |
| Don't-interrupt-critical-work | concept exists, not wired to update | 542 (op-lease) |
| Upgrade-safe config defaults | shipped | 290 |
| **Staged rollout / kill-switch** | **absent** | — |
| **Product telemetry / version analytics** | **absent** (dev-harness ≠ product) | — |
| **Crash reporting (upload)** | **absent** (local dumps only) | — |
| **Index / settings / snapshot migration** | **absent / unversioned** | — (G26 = snapshot bug) |
| **Backup / restore of user data** | **absent** (factory-reset is one-way) | — |
| **Component-independent *update path*** | **absent** | — |
| Feature flags / remote config | absent | — |
| SBOM / changelog automation | absent / manual | — |

## 3. The one genuinely-new thesis: migration asymmetry is the real risk

374 G1 framed the updater as *delivery* plumbing (manifest, keypair, rollback, rollout UX).
The acquire/apply path is well-trodden and `tauri-plugin-updater` covers most of it. The
**under-weighted** risk is downstream of delivery: **the *migrate* layer is mature for
exactly 1 of 5 persisted state stores and absent for the other 4.**

| Store | Versioned? | Migration on version bump |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite job queue (`jobs.db`) | yes (`user_version` V1–V7) | automatic, transactional, backed-up |
| Lucene index (`data/lucene`) | no app-level pin | relies on Lucene internal codec compat |
| UI settings | no | none |
| Worker config snapshot | no | **stale-config bug — 374 G26** |
| Downloaded models / `model-registry.v2.json` | manifest-versioned | immutable per release tag (409) |

A full-auto updater that nails delivery but ships a UI-settings rename or a Lucene major bump
**silently corrupts user state on the first real upgrade**. Per `audit-driven-fixes-need-test`,
"the update is safe" is a hypothesis until an N→N+1 round-trip on real artifacts passes. This
is where the design effort should concentrate — not the manifest plumbing 374 already mapped.

## 4. The decisions to make BEFORE designing

> **Four of these decisions no longer describe the shipped system (see §10.10).**
> D1 was reversed, D7 was resolved implicitly, D4's stated rationale is now false,
> and D5 shipped in a different form. §4 is retained as dated history — read
> §10.10 before treating any decision below as current.

These are the load-bearing forks. Each changes the architecture, not just a parameter. Listed
with what it gates and a recommendation lean (the user decides). **D1–D5 are blocking; D6–D7
scope the first increment.**

### 4.0 Locked decisions + the gating model

**Decisions locked (2026-06-20):**
- **D4 — Signing: stays DEFERRED.** No Authenticode cert purchase now.
- **D5 — Migration contract: FORWARD-ONLY.** Version-stamp every store; an older binary
  refuses to open *newer* state (fail-safe) rather than reverse-migrating. No downgrade support.

**The gating model — auto-update is split into two apply tiers at the code-signing line:**

| | **Tier A — consent-apply (now)** | **Tier B — silent auto-apply (gated)** |
|---|---|---|
| Apply step | app detects + downloads; **user clicks "update," runs the installer** | app applies + relaunches **with no human present** |
| Signing needed | none — the user clicks through SmartScreen, as in today's manual flow | **Authenticode cert** (else SmartScreen/SAC can *block* the silent `.exe` launch — no human to approve) + free Ed25519 update key |
| Ships on | the signing-independent spine (detection + migration + feed) | the spine **+ code signing (D4) + the D6 safety loop** |

So **"full / silent auto-update is gated on code signing"** is the operative constraint, *not*
because signing is legally required but because an unsigned installer auto-launched with no user
present can be blocked by SmartScreen/SAC — which defeats "silent." Two clarifications this rests on:
- The **free Ed25519 update key** (update-payload authenticity) is *not* the deferred-cost item;
  the deferred item is the **paid OV Authenticode cert** (SmartScreen reputation). The paid cert
  is what gates Tier B.
- Tier A is **not** gated — it is genuine "update instead of reinstall," one human click, and it
  ships on work that is needed for Tier B anyway. The detection + forward-only migration + feed
  plumbing is the durable, signing-independent **spine**; Tier B is a thin cap over it.

**Consequence for this doc:** the design target for *now* is Tier A on the spine. Tier B (and its
D6 safety loop) is sequenced behind the signing decision (374 G4), not designed against yet. The
decisions below are read through this lens.

### D1. Mechanism: commit to `tauri-plugin-updater`, or not?
374 leans this way but never *committed*. The alternative is a custom updater (more control,
more code) or notify-only-with-manual-installer (cheapest). **This is the root decision** —
it fixes the manifest format, the signing scheme (Ed25519), the channel model, and the
NSIS-vs-replace apply semantics. *Lean (under the §4.0 gating model): for Tier A now, a thin
notify + consent-apply layer (version check + banner + user runs the NSIS installer) — it needs
no signing and reuses the existing installer.* `tauri-plugin-updater` is oriented to the silent
Tier B path (it requires the Ed25519 key and auto-launches); adopt it when Tier B unblocks, and
verify its NSIS support is first-class then (historically MSI/AppImage were better-trodden).

### D2. Granularity: monolithic install-replacement, or component-level updates?
**The biggest architectural fork.** "The app" = Tauri shell + 2 JVM jars + `llama-server.exe`
(pinned `b8571`) + ORT/CUDA natives + ~9 GB models + UI bundle, each independently *versioned*
today but with no independent *update path*. Options:
- **(a) Monolithic** — every update is a full installer that replaces the ~748 MB app tree;
  **models are reused in place, never re-downloaded** (must be an explicit invariant). Simple;
  `tauri-plugin-updater`-native.
- **(b) Component-level** — patch just the inference binary, just the UI bundle, etc. Powerful
  (a llama.cpp CVE doesn't need a 748 MB push) but `tauri-plugin-updater` doesn't do this; it
  implies a custom layer (conflicts with D1).

*Lean: (a) monolithic for v1, with "app update never touches models" as a hard invariant.*
Component-level is a strong future capability but shouldn't gate v1.

### D3. Autonomy: silent auto-apply, or notify-and-consent?
Per §4.0, this is the Tier A / Tier B split. Silent auto-apply (Tier B) is **gated on D4 (signing)**
and on the D6 feedback loop. *Decision (follows from D4-deferred): Tier A — notify + consent-apply
— is the design target now.* Background *download* may still be automatic; it's silent *apply*
that's gated. Tier B is sequenced behind signing, not designed against yet.

### D4. Signing — **LOCKED: DEFERRED.**
The paid **OV Authenticode cert** (374 G4: cert cost + *"days-to-weeks of CA identity verification"*
+ CI secret handling) is **not** purchased now. Consequence (§4.0): **silent auto-apply (Tier B) is
gated** — an unsigned installer auto-launched with no user present can be blocked by SmartScreen/SAC.
The free **Ed25519 update key** is a separate, free item (only needed once Tier B is in play); not
generated now since Tier A doesn't use it. Tier A is unaffected — the user clicks through SmartScreen
exactly as in today's manual flow. Revisit when 374 G4 lands.

### D5. Migration contract — **LOCKED: FORWARD-ONLY.**
- **Direction**: forward-only. An older binary **refuses to open *newer* state** (fail-safe) rather
  than reverse-migrating; no downgrade/rollback of user data. (This means a bad update's recovery
  story is "reinstall the newer version / wait for a fix," not "roll back" — acceptable given Tier A
  is user-consented, so a user won't be silently moved onto a bad version.)
- **Framework**: build one uniform rule — **version-stamp every store + refuse-newer-in-older** —
  generalizing the SQLite backup-then-migrate pattern to the 4 currently-unversioned stores
  (Lucene pin, UI settings, worker config snapshot, + confirm models). **This is the real,
  signing-independent engineering of G1 and the spine's highest-risk piece** (§3).

### D6. Safety-infra scope for v1: how much rollout machinery ships first?
Staged/phased rollout, server-side **kill-switch** ("halt this release"), **product telemetry**
(which versions are live + update success/failure rate), and **version-tagged crash reporting**
(detect a bad update) are all **absent today** and are what make silent auto-apply (D3) safe.
Decision: build the feedback loop in v1, or ship notify-and-consent (D3) first and add the loop
before flipping to silent? *Lean: defer the full loop — it is part of the Tier B gate, alongside
signing. Tier A (consent-apply) ships without it.* Note: product telemetry is also a
**privacy/consent** decision (opt-in?), not just engineering — worth surfacing to the user explicitly.

### D7. Channel topology & feed: how many channels, hosted where?
374 G2 says channels "just work," but the *count* and the *feed location* are unmade choices:
single feed vs. alpha/beta/stable; manifest hosted on GitHub Releases `/latest` (currently
**undefined** — must be set) vs. a static endpoint vs. the `justsearch-releases` repo (409).
*Lean: stable + beta at launch; manifest off GitHub Releases with a real "latest" pointer;
fold the version-sync enforcement (fail build on drift) in as the prerequisite it is.*

## 5. Investigation order once decisions are made

**The spine (Tier A, signing-independent — buildable now):**
1. **Version hygiene** (D7 prereq) — enforce sync-in-build, set "latest". Cheap, unblocks detection.
2. **State-migration audit** (D5) — the real risk; version-stamp the 4 unversioned stores + the
   refuse-newer-in-older rule; produces the N→N+1 round-trip test that defines "safe."
3. **Detection + consent-apply (Tier A)** (D1/D2/D3) — version check + banner + user-run NSIS
   installer; monolithic, models reused in place.

**The Tier B cap (gated on code signing — sequenced behind 374 G4):**
4. **Signing** (D4) — generate Ed25519 update key + OV-cert procurement, when un-deferred.
5. **Silent apply + safety loop** (D3 Tier B / D6) — `tauri-plugin-updater` adoption + staged
   rollout + kill-switch + telemetry + crash-feedback. Designed once signing lands.

## 6. Remaining open questions for the user (D1/D2/D6/D7 — D4/D5 now locked)
- **D2**: monolithic full-installer updates (models reused in place) confirmed for v1? (Lean: yes.)
- **D7**: one update channel or alpha/beta/stable from launch? (Lean: stable + beta.)
- **D6 (Tier B, later)**: is product telemetry acceptable, and opt-in vs. on-by-default?
- **D1 (Tier B, later)**: commit to `tauri-plugin-updater` for the silent path, or a custom updater?

---

*Next step: confirm the remaining Tier-A questions (D2/D7), then update 374 G1 to point here and
execute §5.1–§5.2 (version hygiene + the migration audit) as the first concrete investigations —
the signing-independent spine — each producing a findings appendix. Tier B (silent apply) stays
sequenced behind 374 G4 (signing).*

## 7. Implemented design (2026-07-31)

### 7.1 Scope and user contract

The implementation is a **monolithic, explicit-consent NSIS update**:

- The always-mounted shell performs a delayed background **check only**.
- An authenticated available release is shown in global chrome and Settings.
- Download and apply begin only after the user activates **Install update**.
- Models under AI Home are not part of the installer artifact and are not
  redownloaded by the app-update path.
- Silent unattended apply, staged rollout, product telemetry, and automatic
  rollback remain out of scope.

The UI is a projection, not a trust authority. Only the Tauri shell can read
the authenticated release feed, download the installer, coordinate shutdown,
or launch the installer. Plugin-facing APIs do not expose those commands.

### 7.2 Authenticated release closed set

A release cut produces one closed set:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `release.v1.json` | Signed JustSearch release identity, monotonic sequence, target, installer digest/size/signature/key, and durable-store compatibility. |
| `release.v1.json.sig` | Detached Ed25519 signature over the exact descriptor bytes. |
| `latest.json` | Tauri updater feed generated from the same descriptor inputs. |
| `JustSearch_<version>_x64-setup.exe` | Monolithic NSIS target. |
| `JustSearch_<version>_x64-setup.exe.sig` | Tauri/Minisign artifact signature. |

`release.v1.json` and `latest.json` must name the same version, URL, and
artifact signature. The shell additionally verifies the descriptor signature,
monotonic release sequence, durable-store compatibility, Tauri signature,
downloaded byte count, SHA-256, and Windows executable shape before preparing
shutdown. A mismatch anywhere fails closed.

Production release endpoint, metadata root public key, and metadata key id are
compile-time inputs. Production accepts HTTPS only. A separately compiled
Sandbox test gate permits runtime overrides and loopback HTTP only; it cannot
enable arbitrary insecure production endpoints.

### 7.3 Persistence closure

`governance/store-recoverability.v1.json` is the compatibility register for
durable authorities across dataDir, AI Home, configuration, shell upgrade
state, and Worker state. Each entry names:

- process owner and owned paths;
- AUTHORED or DERIVED recoverability;
- current and readable legacy format versions;
- atomicity/write mode and corruption policy;
- reconciliation strategy, implementation sources, tests, and fixtures.

The store gate now combines the declared register with a persistence-write
scanner. A new writer cannot silently exist outside the register. Full-rewrite
authored JSON stores use atomic replace, preserve corrupt/future data, read
legacy v0, and emit versioned v1 envelopes. Worker SQLite migration now runs a
pre-writable-header compatibility preflight before a connection can mutate the
database. At implementation close there are no declared compatibility gaps.

### 7.4 Prepare, freeze, shutdown

The implemented protocol reuses the Local API and Worker gRPC transports:

1. Shell calls `POST /api/upgrade/prepare`.
2. Head closes mutating admission, reports real operation-lease blockers, and
   asks Worker to quiesce.
3. Worker stops ingest admission, drains accepted work, performs a final queue
   commit/checkpoint, and returns its graceful outcome.
4. Head returns the preparation id, shutdown nonce, and blocker/loss posture.
5. Shell downloads and independently revalidates the installer.
6. Shell calls `POST /api/upgrade/commit-shutdown` with the same preparation id
   and shutdown nonce.
7. Head acknowledges the frozen preparation, runs its ordered shutdown once,
   and atomically writes `upgrade/head-shutdown-receipt.v1.json`.
8. After observing the original Head child exit, Shell validates the receipt's
   preparation id, nonce, original PID, clean outcome, graceful Worker outcome,
   and empty error set before entering `HEAD_STOPPED`.

Mutating HTTP requests acquire request-scoped operation leases. Long-running
bulk reindex, index GC, rebuild, AI pack import, and runtime activation
operations participate in the same blocker/drain model. Cancellation reopens
admission and Worker ingest only for the matching preparation and nonce.

### 7.5 Durable updater state and recovery

The shell persists:

- `upgrade/intent.v1.json`;
- `upgrade/sequence.v1.json`;
- `upgrade/head-shutdown-receipt.v1.json` (Head-owned);
- `upgrade/installer-launch-witness.v1.json`;
- the staged installer artifact.

The phase vocabulary is closed:

`PREPARED → HEAD_STOPPED → INSTALL_LAUNCHING → INSTALL_LAUNCHED →
RECONCILING → COMMITTED`, with terminal `CANCELLED` and
`REPAIR_REQUIRED`.

Before launch, Shell rehashes the staged artifact. It launches the NSIS updater
with `ShellExecuteExW`, requires a nonzero process witness, and atomically
persists that witness before allowing shell exit. It does not call
`Update::install`, because that API launches through an unobserved path and
exits the process without a recoverable error boundary.

Startup reconciliation is evidence-based:

- A pre-launch intent still on the source version becomes `CANCELLED`.
- A witnessed launched intent on the target version becomes `COMMITTED`.
- Version equality alone never proves success.
- Missing, corrupt, contradictory, or unprovable evidence becomes
  `REPAIR_REQUIRED`.
- If handoff fails after clean Head shutdown, Shell resets the upgrade
  preparation and restarts Head rather than leaving the app unnecessarily
  offline.

### 7.6 UI

`appUpdateState.ts` is the one frontend projection of Tauri updater status.
Settings and `jf-app-update-banner` subscribe to it. The global banner is
visible only for actionable `available` and `repair_required` states and routes
the user to Settings. Settings owns check/install actions and never initiates
install without explicit activation.

### 7.7 Release and Sandbox qualification

Tag release workflow inputs include the metadata signing key, public root,
monotonic release sequence, artifact signing key/id, and production descriptor
URL. Tag builds assemble and verify the complete updater closed set before
upload; ordinary branch installer builds do not pretend to be publishable
updater releases.

The existing `upgrade-from-release` Sandbox lane remains the exact published
installer-over-installer arrival test. The new
`in-app-update-from-release` lane stages a verified loopback release set plus:

- `serve-updater-feed.ps1`;
- `start-in-app-update-test.ps1`;
- `collect-updater-evidence.ps1`;
- `updater-qualification.v1.json` and recovery instructions.

The in-app lane necessarily installs a previous-source Sandbox build compiled
with the updater test gate; an exact production source binary rejects runtime
trust overrides by design. The ordinary upgrade lane therefore remains
required to qualify the exact published previous installer.

## 8. Verification evidence

> **Superseded in part by §10 (2026-07-31).** The list below was accurate about
> what the implementation pass *wrote*, but not about what passed: at handover
> the branch was RED on `./gradlew.bat build -x test` **and** on
> `./gradlew.bat test`, with three separate gate violations. §10 records the
> failures, the fixes, and the first green run.

The focused implementation pass records evidence in source tests and command
output rather than claiming a GUI round that was not run:

- persistence register/scanner gate and its fixture tests;
- atomic store, legacy-read, future-version refusal, and Worker SQLite
  compatibility tests;
- operation lease callback/ack, admission freeze/cancel, Worker quiescence,
  Head shutdown receipt, and lifecycle contract tests;
- Rust descriptor/transition/reconciliation/receipt/witness/reset tests;
- release descriptor build/verify/tamper/key-rotation tests;
- updater UI state/banner/Settings tests, TypeScript check, live Settings
  capture, source-to-step coverage, and six-surface accessibility gate;
- Sandbox launcher in-app lane tests and PowerShell parser checks.

The GUI-gated Windows Sandbox was deliberately not launched during this pass.
Its real NSIS handoff, Windows process witness, state survival, and restart
reconciliation remain release-qualification evidence, not implementation-unit
evidence.

## 9. Remaining gates

Implementation is complete when the full integrated verification below is
green. Release enablement still requires:

1. Configure production metadata signing keys, artifact signing key/id,
   monotonic release sequence, and the HTTPS release descriptor endpoint.
2. Cut two updater-capable candidate versions or an equivalent previous-source
   Sandbox build plus target so the in-app N→N+1 lane is executable.
3. Run the exact published installer-over-release lane.
4. Run the in-app Sandbox lane through normal commit plus at least one captured
   interruption/reconciliation case.
5. Retain the resulting intent, shutdown receipt, launch witness, installed
   version, and authored-state survival evidence.

These are qualification/operations gates. They do not justify weakening
production trust or adding force-kill behavior to NSIS.

## 10. Takeover pass (2026-07-31)

Handover review of the `codex/617-plan` worktree, then remediation. Verify
dated claims against `main`.

### 10.1 Recovery point

At handover ~5.1k lines across 65 files were uncommitted, including **17
untracked** source files (`HeadShutdownCoordinator`, `WorkerUpgradeQuiescence`,
`UpgradeReconciliationProbe`, `appUpdateState`/`AppUpdateBanner`,
`persistence-write-scan.mjs`, the sandbox in-app lane). Untracked files are
invisible to every git recovery path, and this repo has a logged incident of
exactly that loss (`4d94d034`). Committed unmodified as `d81ba603` before any
other work.

### 10.2 Defect: reconciliation validated the receipt against itself

`validate_head_shutdown_receipt` takes an `expected_head_pid`. The live
commit-shutdown path passed a real witness (`backend.child_pid()`,
`updater.rs:414`), but the **restart/reconcile** path passed
`final_receipt.head_pid` — the receipt's own field — so the PID clause compared
the receipt against itself and could not fail. That is the one path where the
live witness is gone.

Fixed in `04866f8f`: `UpgradeIntent` now records `head_pid` at commit-shutdown,
persisted independently, and reconciliation validates against it; missing or
out-of-range fails closed to `REPAIR_REQUIRED`. Additive optional field within
intent v1 (absent reads as `None`, older readers ignore it) — no schema bump,
`check-store-recoverability` green.

**Falsified, not assumed.** `head_receipt_must_match_independently_recorded_pid`
was run against the pre-fix code and *failed* (the forged receipt was accepted),
then passed against the fix. This mirrors the launch witness's existing
`witness_must_match_separate_durable_copy` property.

§7.4's claim that the shell validates the receipt's "original PID" is now true
on both paths; before this fix it was true only on the live path.

### 10.3 The Rust crate ran in no lane

No workflow invoked `cargo test`, `clippy`, or `check` — the only `cargo`
reference in `ci.yml` is a license dump. So the 39 unit tests behind the whole
updater state machine ran once on an author's machine, were cited in §8, and
were never re-run. That is the structural reason 10.2 could survive review.

`83c40ebb` adds a blocking **Shell crate tests (Rust)** lane (windows-latest,
registered in `workflow-signal-policy.v1.json`). It stages a gitignored
placeholder because `tauri_build` hard-fails when the
`resources/headless/**/*` bundle glob matches nothing, and the real payload is
a multi-minute jlink image; packaging is unaffected, since `build-installer.yml`
stages the real bundle. Verified locally with the exact lane command; **not yet
observed on a hosted runner.**

### 10.4 The branch was red — three gate violations

Fixed in `f560e017`, each at its root:

| Gate | Violation | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `checkNoDirectJustsearchSysProp` | new `justsearch.app.version` read directly (3 sites) | registered `EnvRegistry.APP_VERSION` per the documented promotion pattern |
| `UiApiGuardrailsTest` | `UpgradeController` consumed the raw gRPC `UpgradeQuiescenceResponse` (7 violations) — ipc proto types inside `ui.api` | added app-api `WorkerQuiescenceSnapshot`; projection moved into `RemoteKnowledgeClient`, so the generated type stops at the gRPC boundary |
| `LocalApiServerThinComposerTest` | composition root regrew to 31 fields (ceiling 30) | `upgradeKnowledgeServer` duplicated state `HeadAssembly.currentKnowledgeServer()` already owns; removed rather than bumping the ceiling |

The third is worth naming: `HeadlessApp:433-434` calls `connectKnowledgeServer`
immediately before `lateBindKnowledgeServer`, so the root's copy was redundant
**and** could go stale on Worker reconnect. The guardrail was pointing at a real
fork, not just a counter.

`UnreferencedCodeTest` also flagged `LocalApiServer.Builder.operationLeaseService`
as dead. Investigated before waiving: production resolves the lease service via
`HeadAssembly.serviceOut()` with a real `OperationLeaseServiceImpl` fallback
(`LocalApiServer:191-196`), so §7.4's op-lease blocker reporting **is** wired,
not inert. It is a genuine test-only seam and went in the file's documented
allowlist category.

### 10.5 Verification state after this pass

| Tier | Result |
|---|---|
| `./gradlew.bat build -x test` | green (was RED) |
| `./gradlew.bat test` (full suite) | green (was RED) |
| ui-web `typecheck` + unit | green — 373 files, 3826 tests |
| `cargo test --lib --locked` | green — 39 tests |

| Live/GUI Sandbox tiers | **still unrun** — see §9 |

§9 is unchanged and still gates release. Nothing in this pass moved the feature
closer to being *proven*; it moved it to being *honestly green* at the tiers
that can run unattended.

Do not publish this branch as-is. It is 127 commits ahead of `origin/main` and
carries merged `worktree-772-installer-payload`, `worktree-760-codesigntool-ci`,
plus 792/799 commits — work owned by other worktrees that will publish it
themselves. The publishable surface here is the 617 delta only.

That delta is 117 files and is **not** cleanly disjoint: it shares four files
with the 760/772 work, all edited by both sides.

| Shared file | 617 hunks | 760/772 hunks |
|---|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/build-installer.yml` | 4 | 1 |
| `docs/how-to/cut-a-release.md` | 2 | 2 |
| `modules/shell/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | 4 | 2 |
| `modules/ui/build.gradle.kts` | 2 | 5 |

Whoever publishes should expect to reconcile those four by hand, and should
verify by content, not ancestry (`squash-merge-verify-content-not-ancestry`) —
the sibling work may already have landed under a differently-titled squash.

### 10.7 Predecessor-session transcript: triage of its own risk register

The prior Codex session's full transcript was reviewed (3,428 lines). Its last
formal verdict was **"NO-GO for merge or release. Final confidence: 4/10"** —
materially more cautious than this doc's frontmatter, which read
`implemented; release qualification pending`. The doc had drifted optimistic
relative to its author's judgment; the frontmatter is corrected above.

The session ended mid-flow, on *"then I'll run the integrated verification and
independent review"* — neither ran. That, not carelessness, is why §10.4's three
gate violations survived: they were never given a chance to fail. Leaving the
tree uncommitted was likewise a stated policy (*"I'll leave all changes
uncommitted"*), not an oversight — but it is what made §10.1 necessary.

Its confidence trajectory is worth preserving: 6/10 → 7/10 after derisk →
**3/10** after an independent refute-first review that found ten P0/P1 blockers
→ 4/10 after remediation. Confidence fell under scrutiny, twice. The
"version equality is only an observation" rule in §7.5 is a *remediation* of one
of those P0s, not original design — the review loop earned it.

One dated claim needs retiring: the session recorded *"Rust test execution is
blocked locally by Windows Smart App Control."* That diagnosis was wrong. The
real blocker was the unstaged `resources/headless` bundle glob; with SAC still
enforcing, staging a placeholder ran all 39 tests (§10.3). This is the
`ai-offline-isnt-a-wall` handle: a tier declared environmentally unavailable
while a tool for it was at hand.

Its remaining-risk register, re-checked against current code rather than taken
as read:

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| P0 no durable-owner reconciliation protocol | **closed** — `updater.rs:931` gates `COMMITTED` on a durable-owner format check, `UpgradeReconciliationProbe` backs it |
| P0 release workflow cannot publish the closed asset set | **closed** — `tauri.updater.conf.json` overlay carries `createUpdaterArtifacts` + `basicUi`, applied at `package-installer-win.ps1:288-298`, signing secrets wired at `build-installer.yml:231` |
| P0 quiescence coverage incomplete | **partly closed** — see §10.8 |
| P0 Sandbox lane does not exercise the in-app updater | **open** — §9 items 3-4; see §10.12 for what is actually reachable |
| P1 inventory completeness unproven | **closed** — `dd749c1d` |
| P1 authored stores at version 0 | **not a defect** — the two remaining (`byo-ai-assets`, `user-plugin-payloads`) are `PRESERVE_EXTERNAL` formats the app never parses or rewrites; version-stamping them would be meaningless. Run events are versioned |
| P1 Tauri exits after `ShellExecuteW` unchecked | **closed** — §7.5's witnessed `ShellExecuteExW` |
| P1 tempdoc contradicts the implemented Tier-A decision | **closed** — the header note |
| P2 `tauri.conf.json` collides with 772 | **open** — §10.6 |

### 10.8 The quiescence hole, and what is still open

`AiPackImportService` and `RuntimeActivationService` run their work on
background threads that outlive the HTTP request, so the request-scoped mutation
lease in `ApiSecurityFilters` was already released while the write ran.
`POST /api/upgrade/prepare` saw no blocker and reported ready — while a
multi-GB pack could be mid-write into `models/**`, or the GPU runtime mid-swap
under `native-bin/**`. Those are `managed-ai-assets` / `byo-ai-assets`, whose
corruption policy is `NEVER_DELETE_OR_OVERWRITE_UNKNOWN_ASSET`: state the
forward-only contract cannot repair.

Fixed in `32d2f4e6`; each now holds an op-lease for its thread's whole lifetime,
registered on the calling thread before `start()` to close the race window.
§7.4's claim that these two "participate in the same blocker/drain model" was
untrue when written and is true now.

**Still uncovered, and not claimed closed:** agent file operations and other
background writers. Anything that mutates durable state off-request without a
lease reopens the same hole.

### 10.9 Also fixed

Four lines of the cp1252 mojibake described in `agent-lessons.md`
(`utf8-bulk-edits`) — `Â§7`, `â†'` in the phase vocabulary and §9 item 2.

### 10.10 Decision drift: where §4 no longer describes the system

Found by re-reading §4 against §7. §4 stays as written (append-only dated
history); this subsection is the correction layer.

| Decision | §4 says | Shipped | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** mechanism | Tier A is a thin notify + consent-apply layer; `tauri-plugin-updater` is "oriented to the silent Tier B path", adopt it when Tier B unblocks | plugin adopted now, as an authenticated download verifier, with apply hand-rolled | **reversed** — acknowledged in the header note, but §6 listed D1 as an open question *for the user* and no ruling was recorded |
| **D4** signing | LOCKED DEFERRED; the free Ed25519 update key is "not generated now **since Tier A doesn't use it**" | Tier A depends on Ed25519 end-to-end — descriptor signature, artifact signature, the whole §7.2 closed set | **rationale invalidated.** The decision (no paid Authenticode cert) still holds; its stated reason no longer does, and §9 item 1 now requires the key D4 says is unnecessary |
| **D5** migration | one uniform rule: "version-stamp every store + refuse-newer-in-older" | a richer taxonomy — AUTHORED→version, DERIVED→rebuild, EXTERNAL→preserve | **different form, better substance.** You do not migrate what you can regenerate. Not a defect; D5's text was simply never updated |
| **D7** channels | open question for the user; lean "stable + beta at launch" | one descriptor endpoint, monotonic sequence; no channel concept in §7 | **resolved implicitly** to a single channel, and unlike D1 this was never flagged |

The pattern worth naming: §6 reserved D1, D2, D6 and D7 for the user. Three of
the four were settled by implementation instead. D6 (telemetry) is untouched and
correctly remains Tier B.

### 10.11 D2's "hard invariant" has no oracle

D2 requires that a monolithic update reuse models in place and never
re-download them, and says this **"must be an explicit invariant."** §7.1 asserts
it as fact. Nothing enforces it: no test asserts the installer artifact excludes
model blobs, and none asserts an upgrade preserves the AI Home tree. The NSIS
hooks touch only `$COMMONAPPDATA\JustSearch`, so the property is *structurally*
true today — it is simply unguarded.

This is §3's thesis pointed at the largest single asset the product owns. A
future change that swept `models/**` during upgrade would destroy ~9 GB of user
state, and the first signal would be a user report. Per this repo's own tiering,
a load-bearing must belongs in a gate, not prose.

It is also §10.12 seen from another angle: the one lane that would produce
evidence for the invariant is the lane that has never run.

### 10.12 Qualification path, corrected

An earlier draft of this section implied the Sandbox lane was blocked mainly on
a human click. The canonical procedure (`docs/how-to/cut-a-release.md`) is more
specific, and more of it is reachable than that implied:

1. **Artifacts come from CI.** `gh workflow run build-installer.yml --ref main`
   then `gh run download` — no tag needed for a validation candidate. Cutting the
   two updater-capable candidates §9 item 2 requires is therefore an ordinary CI
   action, not a release event.
2. **The Sandbox round is host-interactive by design.** The silent-install
   harness states it plainly: *"the harness needs an interactive GUI session — it
   cannot be driven headless."* GitHub-hosted runners cannot run Windows Sandbox,
   so this cannot move into `build-installer.yml`.
3. **Inside the sandbox, the work is scriptable.** `sandbox-silent-install-test.ps1`
   already proves the shape: a guest script runs and emits a `PASS`/`FAIL` result
   JSON. The in-app lane's `start-in-app-update-test.ps1` +
   `collect-updater-evidence.ps1` can follow it for everything except the consent
   click — and `generate_wsb`'s `LogonCommand`, which currently just opens
   Explorer, could launch the lane directly.
4. **The verifier must not be the implementer.** The release loop requires an
   *independent* verifier and finalizes only on a zero-finding round. So this step
   is not merely "blocked on a human" — it is designed to be someone other than
   whoever wrote the code.

Net: §9 items 1-2 are reachable now; items 3-5 need a GUI host and an
independent verifier, which is the intended shape rather than an obstacle.

### 10.13 Closing the two fit-review gaps

The fit review (§10.10-10.12) named two things as the real gap: D2's invariant
had no oracle, and the N->N+1 machinery could not run without a human. Both are
now closed as far as they can be without a GUI host.

**D2 now has a gate.** `check-update-preserves-models.mjs` asserts the bundle
declares no models tree or weight files, that `bundleSidecarResources` stages no
weights, and that no NSIS hook uses recursive `RMDir /r` or deletes under a
user-data root. Both halves already held; this locks them in. A renamed sidecar
task fails the gate rather than passing vacuously. It is a gate on the
*declared* surface — the Sandbox round is still what proves a built installer.

**And the runtime half was still racy.** Gating the declaration led to sweeping
the off-request writers again, which found the one that matters most:
`AiInstallService.startInstall` spawns a virtual thread that downloads and
promotes ~9 GB into AI Home, including `moveAtomicBestEffort` renaming
`.partial` files into place. No lease. Prepare reported no blocker and the
installer could launch mid-download — the same invariant, unguarded at runtime.
This is the primary model-acquisition path; the pack import fixed earlier is
only the offline sideload of the same assets.

Agent runs stream inside their request and are covered by the request-scoped
lease; the remaining durable stores are passive and write on their caller's
thread. A future writer that moves off-request owes a lease.

**The machinery can now be qualified unattended.** `install_app_update` is a
thin delegate to `run_install_now`, and the lane calls that same function — a
round exercising a parallel path would prove nothing about the shipped one.
`maybe_autorun_qualification` is double-gated (compile-time `option_env!` plus a
runtime opt-in) and spans two boots by construction, because a successful apply
exits the process that started it. `-Autorun` on the lane script, and the
verdict surfaces as `autorunVerdict` in the collected evidence.

This does **not** retire the consent round. "The user is asked before anything
is applied" and "the apply machinery is correct" fail independently; the lane
covers the second, the operator-driven whole-product round covers the first.

**Evidence collection had a hole of its own:** `collect-updater-evidence.ps1`
never gathered `head-shutdown-receipt.v1.json`, though §9 item 5 requires
retaining it and it is the artifact proving Head stopped cleanly rather than
being killed. Every prior capture would have been missing it.

**CI can now build a qualification candidate** (`sandboxTestMode` +
`candidateVersion` dispatch inputs), with a guard that refuses the combination on
a `v*` tag: a published binary honouring runtime trust overrides would hand the
update channel to anything that can set an environment variable. No key material
passes through CI — in test mode the runtime env supplies the trust root, so the
closed set is assembled host-side with test keys.

### 10.14 Refute-first self-review

Reviewer and implementer are the same agent here, which the release loop
explicitly disallows for closure — this is the weaker substitute, and the
independent round is still owed. Recording the negative results, since a failed
refutation is evidence too:

- **"The leases are inert in production."** `OperationLeaseServiceImpl` is
  disabled when `JUSTSEARCH_DEV_RUNNER_STATE_ROOT` is unset, which is the
  production case — this would have made every lease added in this session a
  no-op in the shipped app. It does not: `enabled` gates only the file I/O in
  `rewrite`. `register()` always populates the in-memory `activeLeases` and
  `snapshotLocked()` reads that map.
- **"Some path reaches `HEAD_STOPPED` without recording `head_pid`",** which
  would make §10.2's check fail closed on a legitimate upgrade. There is exactly
  one production transition into `HeadStopped` (`updater.rs:524`), `head_pid` is
  set on the line before, and the transition table admits only
  `Prepared -> HeadStopped`.
- **One finding stood up:** the model-install lease had no cancellation
  callback, so a consented update would sit behind a multi-hour download instead
  of asking it to stop. Fixed in `c301c94e`.

A separate correction from this stretch: a `build.rs` `rerun-if-env-changed`
guard was added on the theory that cargo would reuse a cached object pinned to a
stale trust root, then reverted — probing showed rustc records `option_env!` in
dep-info and cargo honours it, so the defect does not exist and the guard's
rationale was wrong.

### 10.15 Publication is not blocked (correcting §10.6)

Re-checked by content rather than ancestry.

**Both sibling branches have landed.** `origin/main` carries 760's CodeSignTool
bootstrap (`5d12840d`) and 772's payload work — probing
`modules/ui/build.gradle.kts` on `origin/main` finds `cuda-runtime`,
`stageTrimmedOnnxRuntimeGpu` and the `onnxruntime_gpu-*.jar` exclude already
present. §10.6 concluded otherwise from `git log --grep="772"` finding no
`feat(772)` commit, which is precisely what squash-merging destroys.

**The four "shared" files are not shared any more.** Against `origin/main`:

| File | What this branch still changes |
|---|---|
| `.github/workflows/build-installer.yml` | only `sandboxTestMode` / `candidateVersion` / updater — no CodeSignTool or payload additions remain |
| `modules/ui/build.gradle.kts` | only bundling `store-recoverability.v1.json` into resources |
| `modules/shell/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | blank-line removal plus the updater block that moved to the release overlay |
| `docs/how-to/cut-a-release.md` | only the authenticated-updater asset set and trust-input steps |

**The delta is one coherent PR:** 129 files, ~11.8k insertions, all 617. The
only foreign content is two `docs/observations.d/*.md` shards belonging to other
sessions; those ride along by design and are reconciled by the periodic fold.

**The 772 worktree is stale, not active.** Clean tree, last commit 9 days ago,
71 ahead / 70 behind `origin/main`, and the only files touched recently are
`tmp/agent-telemetry/*`. Its work is merged, so it is a cleanup candidate
(`node scripts/dev/remove-worktree.cjs`), not a coordination dependency.

What actually gates publication is therefore **only** the independent review and
the qualification round — not sibling-branch entanglement.

### 10.16 v0.2.0 publication does not close updater qualification (2026-09-03)

The release and signing facts in §§1-4 are dated history. v0.2.0 was published on 2026-08-13;
its installer is Authenticode-signed by Elias Justus and `/releases/latest` is live. Code signing
is therefore no longer deferred or unbought, and the release feed is no longer “no cut.”

That production milestone does **not** supply this tempdoc's missing evidence. The exact published
previous installer still has to be exercised through the installer-over-release lane, and the
in-app N→N+1 path still needs both the normal commit and interruption/reconciliation observations
listed in §9. Until those artifacts exist, the accurate status remains “implementation green at
unattended tiers; release qualification pending.”
