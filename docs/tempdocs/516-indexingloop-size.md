# 516 — IndexingLoop: finish the loop/ops decomposition, type the state machine, externalize construction, enforce the ceiling

**Date**: 2026-05-18
**Status**: done
**Source path**: `modules/worker-services/src/main/java/io/justsearch/indexerworker/loop/IndexingLoop.java`
**Related**:
- `docs/reference/contributing/class-size-standard.md` — 1,000 LOC ceiling + the 13-row precedent matrix
- ADR-0014 (pipeline-definition removal) — the runtime is a state machine, not a DAG
- ADR-0017 (ai-bridge decomposition) — same-module precedent for "delete the abstraction, keep the runtime shape"

- tempdoc 512 §B3 — mega-class concentration audit
- tempdoc 515 — `AppFacadeBootstrap` (2,823 LOC); sibling of the same pattern; coupled to P3
- tempdoc 517 — `SearchOrchestrator` (1,919 LOC); sibling; principles generalize
- `agent-postmortems.md` §`audit-without-test` — tempdoc 403 Tier C; the structural defect P2 addresses

## The issue

`IndexingLoop.java` is **1,955 LOC** — 2× the 1,000 LOC ceiling in
`class-size-standard.md`. It sits alongside two siblings of the same
structural pattern:

- `AppFacadeBootstrap` (Head composition root) — **2,823 LOC** (tempdoc 515)
- `IndexingLoop` (Worker indexing state machine) — **1,955 LOC** (this tempdoc)
- `SearchOrchestrator` (Worker search decision tree) — **1,919 LOC** (tempdoc 517)

All three are *central coordinators*: each is the place where many
concerns naturally attach because it's the only place with all the
context needed for the decisions it makes. The framing in this tempdoc
is symmetric across the three; the design recommendations below apply
to each, with this tempdoc as the case in point.

This document **supersedes** the prior issue-only framing of 516
(deleted 2026-05-18). The prior framing recorded the seams currently
together and the invariants any decomposition must preserve. This
revision keeps those records and adds the *design that addresses why
the class grew and how to prevent recurrence*.

---

## What already exists

Before proposing anything new, the existing infrastructure that
already addresses most of the problem:

- **Package-private collaborator pattern, ratified.** The class-size
  standard documents the pattern and lists **13 prior successful
  decompositions** — including `SummaryController` (3,542 → 909),
  `GrpcSearchService` (2,341 → 474), and `LuceneIndexRuntime` (4,500 →
  1,653 with 11 collaborators). Several of those 11 collaborators
  (`CommitOps`, `IndexingCoordinator`, `DocumentFieldOps`,
  `IndexCountOps`) are exactly the dependencies `IndexingLoop` already
  consumes. The pattern is the codebase's idiom and has the longest
  track record of any decomposition discipline in this project.

- **The `loop/ops/` sub-package, mid-application.**
  `modules/worker-services/.../loop/ops/` already contains
  `LoopPacingPolicy` plus 7 `*BackfillOps` static classes
  (`EmbeddingBackfillOps`, `NerBackfillOps`, `SpladeBackfillOps`,
  `BgeM3BackfillOps`, `DisambiguationBackfillOps`,
  `CombinedEnrichmentBackfillOps`, `IndexingDocumentOps`) totalling
  ~2,500 LOC. Each `*BackfillOps` takes a typed `BackfillContext`
  record carrying its dependencies. **The pattern is established and
  partially applied to this file already.** The shape of the remaining
  work is "finish what's begun," not "introduce something new."

- **Dependency granularity is already correct.** `WorkerSignalBus`,
  `JobQueue`, `IndexingCoordinator`, `CommitOps`, `DocumentFieldOps`,
  `IndexCountOps`, `IndexingPipelineMetricCatalog`,
  `IngestionOutcomeMetricCatalog` are all the right size and the right
  named abstractions. `IndexingLoop`'s problem is **not** that its
  dependencies are too coarse; it is that the loop class itself does
  too much *on top of* them.

- **ADR-0014 — the binding shape constraint.** The pipeline-engine +
  pipeline-executor + DAG-spec (~6,600 LOC) was deleted because the
  runtime never followed the abstraction. ADR-0014 names this file
  specifically: *the runtime is a state machine, not a DAG.* Any
  redesign of `IndexingLoop` must produce a **smaller state machine
  in the same shape**, not a different shape. This is the
  non-negotiable boundary on what the decomposition is allowed to look
  like.

- **ADR-0027 MetricCatalog.** The typed telemetry pattern is already in
  use here (`IndexingPipelineMetricCatalog`,
  `IngestionOutcomeMetricCatalog`, `IngestionOutcomeTags`,
  `PipelineStageTags` all live in the `loop/` package). No new
  telemetry primitive is needed for any of the decomposition work.

---

## Why the class grew anyway — four structural pressures

The class is not 1,955 LOC because the patterns are missing. It is
1,955 LOC because of four specific structural pressures:

### a. The `loop/ops/` decomposition was started but not finished

Backfill ops were extracted in earlier work. The three other natural
seams were not:

- **Primary indexing pipeline** (`extractJob` → `writeExtractedJob` →
  `indexChunks` → `handleStaleAfterSnapshot`, plus the `ExtractedJob`
  record) — ~620 LOC. Structurally parallel to the `*BackfillOps`
  already in the package.
- **Ingestion-outcome journal** (`recordOutcomeSafely`, the three
  `outcome*` builders, the two `ledgerEntry` overloads,
  `drainPendingMarkDone`, `drainGroup`, `isPartialSuccessTransition`,
  `pendingMarkDone` field) — ~200 LOC.
- **Embedding-provider lifecycle** (`handleGpuStateTransition`,
  `unloadEmbeddingService`, `notifyEmbeddingProviderChange`,
  `maybeFinalizeEmbeddingRebuildIfNeeded`, `allowEmbeddingWrites`,
  `refreshEccStoredFingerprint`, the listener registry, the
  `embeddingLifecycleLock`) — ~200 LOC. Distinct concern with its own
  lock and its own regression history (309 §33).

These three weren't extracted because the prior backfill-extraction
work targeted the easy wins. The hard wins remained.

### b. Construction is staged from upstream

Four overloaded constructors plus seventeen setters exist on
`IndexingLoop` because `DefaultWorkerAppServices` constructs the loop
in stages and fans the same values out to the search service, ingest
service, and health service in stages. Every "wire service X" task
appends another setter to each of the four central coordinators
involved.

The setter sprawl is a **composition-root problem, not a loop
problem.** It is structurally identical to the bug-class at the
center of tempdoc 515 (`AppFacadeBootstrap`) — same shape on opposite
sides of the gRPC boundary.

### c. The state machine is stringly-typed

`currentState` is a `String` field with `STATE_IDLE` /
`STATE_RUNNING` / `STATE_PAUSED` as string constants. The state graph
is not derivable from the type system; it can only be reconstructed by
reading the 290-line `runLoop()` body and grepping for
`setCurrentState`.

This is the structural defect that enabled the **tempdoc 403 Tier C
incident**: a static audit said `analyzerRegistry` was the only
restart blocker; the state machine was also a blocker; the audit
could not see it because the FSM was invisible to the type checker.
The lesson recorded in `agent-postmortems.md` §`audit-without-test`
is "static audits are hypotheses; the test is truth." The lesson
addresses *audit discipline*. The state-typing defect addresses *the
conditions that made the audit possible to get wrong in the first
place.*

### d. No mechanical trip-wire enforces the ceiling

The class-size standard is documentation. Nothing in CI or the local
gates fails the build when a file crosses 1,000 LOC. Three classes
sit simultaneously over the ceiling (515 / 516 / 517). Without
enforcement, the *next* central coordinator will be too — the discipline
fights gravity for each individual file but has no mechanical brake
that catches the pattern recurring.

---

## The design — five principles

These five principles together address why the class grew (pressures
a–d) and how to prevent recurrence. They are long-term-correct: each
relieves a structural pressure rather than treating its current
symptom. They are **not** feasibility-bounded — the slice that picks
this up decides scope and sequencing.

The principles generalize across 515 / 516 / 517. The case in point
here is 516. P3 and P4 are coupled across all three; P1, P2, and P5
are per-class but follow the same shape.

### P1. Finish the `loop/ops/` extraction

*Appendix A.1 + A.6: 3 of 5 proposed seams are dirty; the principle
stands but the slice scope must add a return-outcomes contract +
coordination hooks for 8 cross-seam constraints. LOC residue revised
to ~480, not ~300.*

Apply the established `*Ops` + `BackfillContext`-style record idiom
to the three remaining seams named in pressure (a):
`JobBatchExtractor`, `JobBatchWriter`, `IngestionOutcomeJournal`,
`EmbeddingProviderLifecycle`, plus `BackfillScheduler` (which captures
the *sequencing policy* over the existing backfill ops — see P5 for
why this is a sequencing helper, not a registry).

After P1, `IndexingLoop` is approximately ~300 LOC of: the `while
(running)` skeleton, the typed state machine from P2, `start()` /
`stop()` / `close()`, and delegation to the collaborators. No new
package; no new pattern; the seams are already named in the file's
own `==================== Section ====================` comments.

### P2. Type the state machine

*Appendix A.2 + A.7: 3-state cardinality confirmed; three caveats
added; the invariant gate is two-tier, not one.*

Replace `String currentState` + the `STATE_*` constants with `enum
LoopState { IDLE, RUNNING, PAUSED }` and a small number of named
transition methods. The state graph becomes derivable from the type
system; future audits of state-related behavior can be answered by
grepping over the enum and transition method names rather than by
reading the entire loop body.

P2 directly addresses the tempdoc 403 Tier C bug-class. The correct
framing is not "make the same audit work better" — it is "remove the
conditions that made the audit possible to get wrong." A typed FSM is
visible to `javac`; a stringly-typed one is not.

### P3. Externalize construction

*Appendix A.3 + A.5: the "single deps record" framing is refuted by
async model-load lifecycle; viable as 7-of-13 setters collapse + a
typed registry for the rest. The "coupled to tempdoc 515" claim below
is **wrong** — P3 actually couples to tempdoc 517.*

Replace 4 constructors + 17 setters with a single typed
`IndexingLoopDependencies` record passed to one constructor. The
setters become fields on the record. The dependency-staging logic in
`DefaultWorkerAppServices` becomes the responsibility of an upstream
builder that produces the record fully populated.

P3 is **coupled to tempdoc 515**. The same typed-deps-record pattern
is the right construction idiom for every central coordinator on
both sides of the gRPC boundary. When `AppFacadeBootstrap` is
decomposed under 515's principles, the per-service typed-deps-record
becomes the natural construction pattern for everything the facade
wires — including `IndexingLoop` via `DefaultWorkerAppServices`. The
two tempdocs should land symmetrically; per-side scheduling is a user
decision.

### P4. Bind the size standard to a mechanical rule with a grandfather list

*Appendix A.4: mechanism refined to custom Gradle task +
`gradle/class-size-exceptions.txt` (ratchet), not ArchUnit / PMD
annotation. `@SuppressWarnings` grandfathering barred by CLAUDE.md:32.*

Add an ArchUnit (or equivalent — PMD `ExcessiveClassLength`,
Checkstyle `FileLength`, custom Gradle task) rule that fails the build
on any Java source file > 1,000 LOC. Initialize with an exception list
containing `AppFacadeBootstrap`, `IndexingLoop`, `SearchOrchestrator`.
Each subsequent decomposition removes its entry. New violations are
rejected at PR-time.

P4 is the only principle that **prevents recurrence**. P1 / P2 / P3
are one-shot interventions on this file (and its 515 / 517 siblings).
P4 is the trip-wire that catches the *next* central coordinator
before it gets to 2,000 LOC.

The class-size-standard doc already cites that no ArchUnit rule binds
the ceiling today — explicitly because adding one would fail the
build immediately on the current violators. The grandfather list is
the bridge from "doc-only standard" to "enforced rule"; the list
shrinks as each decomposition completes.

### P5. Do not introduce a new orchestration abstraction

No `LoopPhase` interface, no `BackfillStrategy` registry, no
configurable schedule, no DAG, no plug-in points, no
"PipelineStageDescriptor" record, no `IndexingLoopBuilder` that
"composes phases."

ADR-0014 is explicit: the pipeline-engine + executor + DAG-spec was
deleted because the runtime never followed the abstraction. Any
redesign that re-introduces "pluggable phases" or "configurable
ordering" repeats the deleted mistake. The codebase has paid for that
lesson once already (~6,600 LOC deleted, ~5 months elapsed).

Each collaborator extracted under P1 is a **named piece of the state
machine**, not an **implementation of a strategy**. The
`BackfillScheduler` named in P1 is a sequencing helper for the
specific known set of backfill kinds (combined / embedding / chunk /
NER / SPLADE / disambiguation) with the gating rules ADR-0004 / 334
already encode — it is **not** an extensible registry that admits new
kinds via plugin.

P5 is the discipline boundary that bounds P1–P3. It is non-negotiable
per ADR-0014. Any slice executing this tempdoc must Pass-8-verify
that the extracted collaborators preserve the state-machine shape
rather than re-introducing pipeline-engine-style abstractions in
miniature.

## Invariants the decomposition must preserve

(Verbatim from the prior 516 issue record, with one addition surfaced
by P2 / P3. Verify against code before decomposing.)

- **One Worker per index** (ADR-0001, ADR-0003): only one
  `IndexingLoop` runs per `indexBasePath`. `IndexRootLock` enforces at
  the process boundary; this class assumes it.
- **GPU mutex cooperation** (ADR-0004 lineage): when
  `main_gpu_active` is set, embedding GPU work yields. The state field
  `lastMainGpuActiveState` + `embeddingLifecycleLock` are load-bearing
  for this cross-process protocol. P1's `EmbeddingProviderLifecycle`
  must carry the lock and the MMF read together.
- **Commit-meta freshness** (`adapters-lucene` commit metadata): each
  commit cycle invokes a *fresh* metadata supplier; commit triggers
  respect this contract.
- **Breath-holding** (user-presence pause): when a user is active,
  background work yields. `BREATH_HOLD_MS` + MMF user-activity
  timestamp.
- **Stage telemetry** (`recordStageMs` + reason codes per the SSOT
  reason-codes catalog). Decomposition must not lose this emission
  surface; ADR-0027's typed catalog pattern is the channel.
- **Migration safety** (`migrationActiveSupplier`): during blue/green
  schema migration, certain backfill steps pause.
- **Restart blockers**: tempdoc 403 Tier C is the precedent that the
  *current set* of restart blockers cannot be re-derived from a static
  audit. **P2 must be preceded by a runnable test that exercises
  start/stop/start cycles end-to-end** — not by a fresh audit. The
  `agent-postmortems.md` §`audit-without-test` rule applies
  unconditionally to this work.

---

## What this tempdoc is *not*

- **Not a slice.** A subsequent slice (or pair of slices, since P3 is
  coupled to tempdoc 515) picks up the implementation.
- **Not a per-method extraction map.** The principles fix the *shape*;
  the per-method-to-collaborator mapping is a slice-level artifact.
- **Not a claim that the runtime shape is wrong.** ADR-0014 endorses
  the state-machine shape; P1–P3 produce a smaller state machine in
  the same shape. P5 is the explicit guarantee of this.
- **Not a unilateral verdict that 515 / 517 should decompose on the
  same timeline as 516.** The principles generalize; the sequencing
  across siblings is a user decision. P3 and P4 are the only
  principles that *require* coordination (P3 with 515 via shared
  construction idiom; P4 across all three via the grandfather list).

---

## Next reader

- **tempdoc 515** — sibling problem on the Head side. **Coupling
  refuted by Appendix A.5**: different sprawl shape (registration +
  getter sprawl, not setter fan-out); independent decomposition.
- **tempdoc 517** — sibling problem on the Worker search side.
  **Coupling confirmed by Appendix A.5 at the shared substrate
  level**: a `WorkerSearchDeps` (or equivalent) typed record extracted
  for 516's P3 dissolves 4–5 of SearchOrchestrator's setters as a
  near-free byproduct. Principles P1, P2, P4, P5 apply directly per
  the 3×5 matrix in Appendix A.5.
- **ADR-0014** — the binding shape constraint; the cost record of the
  last time this lesson was ignored.
- **`docs/reference/contributing/class-size-standard.md`** — the
  pattern, the 13-row precedent matrix, and the P4 enforcement hole
  named in the doc itself.
- **`agent-postmortems.md` §`audit-without-test`** — the bug-class P2
  removes, and the invariant for any test preceding P2.
- **tempdoc 512 §B3** — the mega-class audit that surfaced all three
  size violations.
- **tempdoc 403 Tier C** — the cautionary case the P2 design
  addresses; required reading for any agent picking up the slice.

## Appendix A — Confidence audit (2026-05-18)

Seven investigations were dispatched to test the five principles in
§"The design" against the live code. The body is preserved for the
design rationale; the appendix supersedes the body wherever they
conflict. The reader for the implementing slice should treat Appendix
A as the authoritative refinement and the body as the design history
that produced it.

### A.1 Seam cleanliness (P1) — **modified**

Investigation A built a field-to-method matrix across `IndexingLoop`'s
~30 instance fields against P1's five proposed collaborators.

**Per-seam verdict:**

| Collaborator | Verdict | Shared mutable state with |
|---|---|---|
| **JobBatchExtractor** | dirty | Writer (`batchIndexed/Skipped/Failed`); Journal (`bestEffortDeleteMissingSource` chain via `extractJob` L954) |
| **JobBatchWriter** | dirty | Extractor (batch counters); Journal (`pendingMarkDone`, `recordOutcomeSafely`, `ledgerEntry`); commit-driver (`indexedSinceCommit`) |
| **IngestionOutcomeJournal** | dirty + mis-homed | Writer (`pendingMarkDone`); Extractor + Writer (both call `ledgerEntry`, currently bundled with Journal but is a pure factory); `bestEffortDeleteMissingSource` straddles all three |
| **EmbeddingProviderLifecycle** | mostly clean | commit-driver only (`maybeFinalizeEmbeddingRebuildIfNeeded` writes `lastCommitTime`/`indexedSinceCommit` + calls `commitOps.commitAndTrack`) |
| **BackfillScheduler** | clean | — (owns scheduler-only fields exclusively) |

**Refined LOC residue.** Body claimed "~300 LOC." Audit estimate
revised to **~480 LOC** (residue = runLoop scaffolding ~150 +
constructors/setters ~140 + start/close/reset/state accessors ~140 +
helpers ~30 + commit-driver block that can't move).

**Resolution shape.** P1 as written ("extract collaborators") replaces
field-coupling with parameter-coupling unless paired with a
**return-outcomes contract**: Extractor and Writer return tagged
outcome values (`ExtractionOutcome = Extracted | Skipped | Failed |
StaleDeleted`; `WriteOutcome { indexed, chunks, transition,
failureToJournal }`); the runLoop residue tallies them into a
**BatchStats** value object and enqueues to **Journal** via
`journal.enqueueDone(transition)`. Without this, the four extractions
either (a) widen each collaborator's seam to depend on commit-driver,
or (b) require a new shared substrate (which risks the P5 boundary).
**Re-homing:** `ledgerEntry` becomes a static `LedgerEntryFactory`
read by both Extractor and Writer; `bestEffortDeleteMissingSource`
moves to a shared `StaleSourceHandler` invoked by Extractor (extract
path) and Writer (post-snapshot path), not Journal.

**Falsifies P1?** Partially — the four extractions are not "clean
lift-and-shift." The principle stands; the *coordination shape* needs
adding to the slice scope. See Appendix A.6 for the per-constraint
hooks the slice must preserve.

### A.2 State machine cardinality (P2) — **confirmed with three caveats**

Investigation B enumerated every state write (4 sites), every reader
(internal + 6 external), and grepped the whole tree for implicit
states.

- **Cardinality is 3.** `IDLE`, `RUNNING`, `PAUSED` is the complete
  set. RELOADING (mentioned at IndexingLoop.java L147) is
  comment-only — never a runtime value, never an enum case, never
  compared as a string. The other "implicit" flags
  (`lastMainGpuActiveState`, `migrationActiveSupplier`,
  `disambiguationPassComplete`, `embeddingProvider.isAvailable()`,
  `signalBus.isUserActive()`) are **orthogonal inputs**, not states —
  they compose with the enum at decision sites, they don't extend it.
- **External read surface (6 sites).** The state crosses the wire via
  `WorkerAppServices.indexingLoopState() →
  GrpcHealthService.workerStateSupplier →
  HealthCheckResponse.workerState → HealthNodeView.workerState`.
  `ChaosSuiteTest` (system-tests) asserts the literal `"PAUSED"` from
  the wire; `KnowledgeServer:1127` is a metrics gauge using
  `"PAUSED".equals(st)`; 4 unit tests stub `getCurrentState()`
  returning `"IDLE"`.

**Three caveats for the implementing slice:**

1. **Preserve wire-string identity via `enum.name()`.** The wire emitter
   chain must continue to emit `"IDLE"`/`"RUNNING"`/`"PAUSED"` exactly.
   Using `LoopState.name()` keeps the wire bit-identical.
2. **Route `L1742` reset through `setCurrentState`.** The direct field
   write in `resetForProfiling` bypasses the named transition (the
   only such bypass in the file); fold it through the typed transition
   helper for completeness.
3. **Decide about `GrpcHealthService:43-45` duplicates.** A duplicate
   `STATE_*` constant trio lives there, used only in the no-supplier
   fallback at L313/319 (unreachable in production since
   `DefaultWorkerAppServices` always wires the supplier). Either
   delete or document.

**Falsifies P2?** No.

### A.3 Construction lifecycle (P3) — **refuted as literally written; partially viable**

Investigation C traced `DefaultWorkerAppServices`'s
`DeferredRuntime → upgradeWriter → initDeferredModels` lifecycle.

- **The setter count is 13** (not 17 — the body's "17" included
  peer-service setters that DWAS fans the same value to, e.g.,
  `searchService.setEmbeddingProvider`, `healthService.setBgeM3Encoder`).
- **`IndexingLoop` is constructed before async model loads complete.**
  `initDeferredModels` is a background thread that loads ONNX-backed
  encoders (`EmbeddingProvider`, `NerService`, `SpladeEncoder`,
  `BgeM3Encoder`, `DisambiguationService`, `EmbeddingCompatController`,
  plus the `addEmbeddingProviderChangeListener` subscription). These
  six setters are **late-bound by necessity**, not by convenience —
  the dependencies do not exist at IndexingLoop's constructor call.
- The remaining seven setters (`setDetailedTracing`,
  `setPathResolutionStore`, `setMigrationActiveSupplier`,
  `setCommitMetadataSupplier`, `setEmbeddingTelemetryEvents`,
  `setEmbeddingProviderChangeListener`, and the existing
  embedding-service ctor slot) are late-bound by **convenience** —
  the values either pre-exist at DWAS construction or are
  trivially derivable from `ingestRunning`.

**Refined P3 shape.**

- 7-of-13 setters collapse into an `IndexingLoopDependencies` record
  passed to the ctor.
- 5–6 surviving late-binders are replaced with a **typed registry
  facade** (working name: `EncoderBindings` for the four encoders +
  an `EmbeddingProviderRegistry` for the provider + multi-listener
  fan-out) the loop holds. The registry is passed in at ctor time
  empty; KS calls `.bind(...)` after `initDeferredModels` completes,
  and the fan-out from DWAS to peer services stays as-is.
- The body's "single `IndexingLoopDependencies` record" is
  unachievable without restructuring KS's startup ordering, which is
  out of P3's scope.

**Falsifies P3?** Yes for the literal "single record" framing.
Reshaped to "ctor record + typed registry for the async-loaded
encoders" the principle stands and still removes 13 setter methods
from the public API surface (replacing them with one registry
interface + one ctor argument).

### A.4 Size enforcement (P4) — **confirmed; mechanism refined**

Investigation D mapped the existing enforcement surface.

- **Nothing enforces file/class LOC today.** PMD is configured
  (`config/pmd/ruleset.xml`, plugin `7.16.0` per
  `JvmBaseConventionsPlugin.kt:158`; **version drift** to `7.22.0` in
  root `build.gradle.kts:19`) but `ExcessiveClassLength`/`NcssCount`/
  `TooManyMethods` are not in the ruleset. PMD is gated off locally
  unless `CI=true`. No Checkstyle. **18 ArchUnit test classes** exist
  but none use `JavaClass.getSource()` or any file-LOC mechanism. No
  custom Gradle file-size task. No PMD/ArchUnit baseline files.
- **`CLAUDE.md:32` bars `@SuppressWarnings` to silence warnings.**
  This closes off the PMD annotation-based grandfathering path. XML
  suppression and external file-based exceptions are not annotations
  and are not barred.

**Refined mechanism (single recommendation):** a **custom Gradle
task** wired into `check` via `JvmBaseConventionsPlugin`, reading a
plain-text exception file (`gradle/class-size-exceptions.txt`) with
one row per exempted relative path + current LOC + ratchet date.
Rationale: the standard counts *file* LOC (per
`class-size-standard.md:14`), not *class* LOC; PMD's
`ExcessiveClassLength` counts class bodies and mis-measures files
with nested types or license headers; ArchUnit's
`JavaClass.getSource()` returns a URI but doesn't directly expose
line count and inverts class↔file granularity; a custom task matches
the existing convention pattern (Spotless, PMD, SpotBugs all live in
`JvmBaseConventionsPlugin`) and provides file granularity directly.

**Grandfather list shape.** Ratchet-only: the task fails if a listed
file's LOC exceeds the pinned value (decomposition can only reduce).
Removing a row requires the file to be ≤ 1,000 LOC. Initial rows:
`AppFacadeBootstrap.java 2823 2026-05-18`,
`IndexingLoop.java 1955 2026-05-18`,
`SearchOrchestrator.java 1919 2026-05-18`.

**Falsifies P4?** No — mechanically implementable. The body's
"ArchUnit (or PMD `ExcessiveClassLength`)" parenthetical is wrong;
the correct mechanism is the custom Gradle task.

### A.5 Sibling cross-check (515 / 517) — **partially refutes the body's coupling claims**

Investigation E read AppFacadeBootstrap and SearchOrchestrator
through the lens "is this the same bug-class?"

**3 × 5 verdict matrix:**

| Principle | 515 AppFacadeBootstrap | 516 IndexingLoop | 517 SearchOrchestrator |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** (finish sub-package extraction) | applies, different shape — `bootstrap/` sub-package has 220 LOC extracted vs 2,823 remaining | applies (body) | applies, **no sub-package started** |
| **P2** (type the state machine) | **N/A** — no internal state field | applies | **N/A** — stateless |
| **P3** (externalize construction) | **different shape** — registration sprawl (~30 `register*` calls in `registerLateBoundHandlers`) + getter sprawl (~50 collaborator fields), **not** setter fan-out | applies | applies — **same Worker substrate** as 516 (6 package-private setters wired by the same DWAS `wire*` methods) |
| **P4** (size enforcement) | applies (2,823) | applies (1,955) | applies (1,919) |
| **P5** (no new abstraction) | risk: `ContributorRegistry` / `BootstrapContributor` SPI temptation | risk: ADR-0014 DAG | risk: `EncoderBundle` + `SearchMode` strategy temptation |

**Key refutation: the body's "P3 coupled to tempdoc 515" claim is
wrong.** AppFacadeBootstrap holds zero of the Worker encoder/embedding
types and never calls `set*` on `IndexingLoop` or `SearchOrchestrator`.
The two surfaces share no mutable value that a single typed-deps
record could span. The body's text in P3 and §"What this tempdoc is
*not*" overstating cross-process coupling should be read against this
refutation.

**Confirmed: P3 *does* couple to tempdoc 517.** SearchOrchestrator
has 6 package-private setters wired by the same DWAS `wire*` methods
(`wireEmbeddingProvider` at DWAS:240 pushes the same value into
`indexingLoop` + `searchService` + `healthService`, and the
`searchService` arm forwards to SearchOrchestrator + CitationMatchOps
+ RagContextOps). A `WorkerSearchDeps`-style record extracted for
516's P3 dissolves 4–5 of SearchOrchestrator's setters as a near-free
byproduct.

**Refined cross-tempdoc coupling map:**

- **P3**: coupled at substrate level **between 516 + 517 only**.
  Independent of 515.
- **P4**: per-class enforcement; the exception file is shared
  infrastructure, but each row is independent.
- **P1, P2, P5**: per-class, no coupling. P2 doesn't apply to 515 or
  517 at all.

### A.6 Perf-tuning constraints register (cross-cutting) — **inserts 43 constraints + 7 surprises**

Investigation F enumerated every behavior in `IndexingLoop.java`
that exists because someone measured a regression or saved a
measurable cost. 43 constraints catalogued, 8 cross-seam, 7 surprises
beyond Investigation A's findings.

**8 cross-seam constraints requiring named coordination hooks.** Each
spans ≥2 P1 collaborators; the slice must preserve them via a named
interface, not by ad-hoc field sharing.

| # | Constraint | Hook required |
|---|---|---|
| 5/29/32 | Migration-active inline embedding (312 Phase 4): 8.6 > 7 docs/sec RMW with inline-embed during blue-green rebuild | `ExtractedBatch` carries optional `float[][] precomputedEmbeddings`; Writer accepts; Embedding owns `migrationActiveSupplier` |
| 11 | Rebuild-fingerprint stamp commit (Embedding → commit-driver) | Embedding exposes `shouldStampRebuild()`; runLoop residue performs commit + notifies via `onFingerprintStamped()` |
| 12 | Post-commit ECC fingerprint refresh — **called from 4 commit sites** (idle, time/buffer, shutdown, rebuild stamp) | Commit-driver emits `CommitCompleted` event; Embedding subscribes (single hook, not 4 scattered call sites) |
| 17/19 | Tight-loop NRT suspend/resume + final flush (334 Phase 8, saves ~91s/97 batches) | Commit-driver exposes scoped `withNrtSuspended(Runnable)` token; Scheduler uses try-with-resources; Scheduler invokes `commitDriver.flush(reason)` directly |
| 24 | Rebuild-finalize polling from both idle and active branches | Keep call site in runLoop residue; Embedding's method must remain re-entrant + cheap on no-op (it already is) |
| 26 | Time-gated SPLADE interleave (278 4a): caps primary-indexing overhead at ~13% | Scheduler exposes `maybeInterleaveSplade(long nowMs)`; runLoop residue calls it after the commit check using the *same* `now` |
| 37/38 | GPU handoff requires no in-flight write conflict | Embedding's transition method must remain invoked from the loop scaffold (not Writer/Scheduler), preserving its "above poll" position |
| 43 | Self-committing idle backfill vs non-committing interleaved backfill | Scheduler keeps two entry points: `runIdleBackfill` self-commits; `runInterleavedBackfill` returns indexed count and lets the runLoop commit-driver own the trigger |

**7 surprises beyond Investigation A:**

1. **NRT suspend/resume couples Scheduler to commit-driver** — body
   assumed Scheduler is commit-agnostic; it isn't.
2. **Post-commit ECC refresh is a 4-site cross-cutting hook**, not a
   single ownership boundary.
3. **Rebuild-stamp commit mutates `indexedSinceCommit`** — the body's
   "Embedding owns `maybeFinalizeEmbeddingRebuildIfNeeded`" hides this
   commit-driver invariant write.
4. **`resetForProfiling` touches state owned by Scheduler + Extractor +
   Journal + Embedding** — must dispatch per-collaborator
   `resetForProfiling()`, not stay in residue.
5. **`indexEmptyForBatch` is per-batch shared state** between
   `processBatchInner` setup and `extractJob` callees — must move
   with them as a unit.
6. **Migration-active inline embedding spans 3 collaborators** via the
   `precomputedEmbedding` payload — requires an `ExtractedBatch` shape
   with optional precomputed vectors.
7. **SPLADE interleave shares the commit-decision `now` timestamp** —
   not a free-standing Scheduler call; the same `long now` must thread
   through both.

The complete 43-row register (with line refs and tempdoc origins)
lives in the audit transcript and should be re-derived by the slice
agent at implementation time — each constraint pin a regression a
prior measurement caught.

### A.7 Test coverage (G) — **two-tier gate required for P2's invariant**

Investigation G mapped existing tests to P1 seams and designed the
restart-blocker test gating P2.

**Coverage matrix (summarized):**

| Seam | Tests | What's missing |
|---|---|---|
| JobBatchExtractor | 8 | cross-seam counter invariants (`batchIndexed+Skipped+Failed == jobs.size()`) |
| JobBatchWriter | 6 | `indexedSinceCommit` accumulation; commit-trigger thresholds |
| IngestionOutcomeJournal | 3 | `bestEffortDeleteMissingSource` isolation; drain ordering across restart |
| EmbeddingProviderLifecycle | 5 (UnloadTelemetryEmitTest) | **`maybeFinalizeEmbeddingRebuildIfNeeded` — zero tests**; commit-from-embedding path |
| BackfillScheduler | 0 direct (covered by `*BackfillOpsTest`) | tight-loop deferral; SPLADE↔NER interleave; post-restart pickup |
| **State machine transitions** | **0** | every transition (the file's `setRunning(loop, true)` reflection bypasses `runLoop()`) |
| **Restart cycle** | **0** | exactly the tempdoc 403 Tier C blind spot |

**Restart-blocker test design (P2 gate) — two tiers required.**

- **Tier A (worker-services unit, cheap):** new `IndexingLoopRestartTest`
  using mocked `IndexingCoordinator` + real `loopThread` +
  `RecordingQueue`, asserting state-machine and counter reset across
  `close()`/`start()`. Pseudocode skeleton in the audit transcript.
  Catches: stuck `running=true`; non-reset counters
  (`indexedSinceCommit`, `batchIndexed`); leaked `pendingMarkDone`;
  loopThread that fails to terminate; FSM wedged at PAUSED; embedding
  listener leakage across restarts; the analyzer-registry /
  coordinator class of bugs from tempdoc 403 Tier C.
- **Tier B (system-tests integration, one test):** new
  `IsolatedBackendFixture`-based test that ingests, restarts the
  child JVM, ingests again, queries `/api/status`. Catches:
  multi-process JVM-restart class. Without Tier B the gate is
  incomplete in the exact way tempdoc 403 Tier C was incomplete (the
  audit said "only blocker X"; the live runtime found two more).
- **Fixtures inventory:** `IsolatedBackendFixture` exists at
  `modules/system-tests/src/integrationTest/java/io/justsearch/systemtests/harness/IsolatedBackendFixture.java`
  (heavy: child JVM, ~6s cold start; right tool for Tier B but
  wrong for Tier A). Worker-services has no in-memory Lucene
  fixture; one would need to be created or lifted from
  `adapters-lucene`.

**Per-extraction gating recommendation:**

- **JobBatchExtractor**: new test — cross-seam counter assertions
  before extraction.
- **JobBatchWriter**: extend
  `successfulWriteRecordsSuccessOnlyWhenMarkDoneDrains` with
  `indexedSinceCommit` + commit-threshold assertions.
- **IngestionOutcomeJournal**: extend `drainPendingMarkDone`-suite
  tests + a direct `bestEffortDeleteMissingSource` test.
- **EmbeddingProviderLifecycle**: new test alongside
  `IndexingLoopUnloadTelemetryEmitTest` covering
  `maybeFinalizeEmbeddingRebuildIfNeeded` (the rebuild-stamp
  commit + `commitAndTrack` invocation + `refreshEccStoredFingerprint`).
- **BackfillScheduler**: no new test — the seam is clean and
  `*BackfillOpsTest` covers ops-level behavior.

**Falsifies P2's invariant gating?** No — feasible but the body's
single "runnable test before P2 lands" needs to become a two-tier
gate (A + B). The body's reference to
`agent-postmortems.md §audit-without-test` stands; the gate is
realized as the two tiers above.

### Summary table

| Principle | Status after audit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **P1** | **modified** | 3 of 5 seams are dirty; needs a return-outcomes contract + BatchStats value object + re-homing of `ledgerEntry` (factory) and `bestEffortDeleteMissingSource` (shared handler); residue revised from ~300 to ~480 LOC |
| **P2** | **confirmed (cardinality) + 3 caveats** | Preserve wire-string via `.name()`; route L1742 reset through `setCurrentState`; decide about `GrpcHealthService:43-45` duplicates |
| **P3** | **refuted as literally written; reshaped** | 7 of 13 setters collapse to ctor record; 5–6 survive as a typed registry (`EncoderBindings` + `EmbeddingProviderRegistry`) — async model loading prevents the single-record collapse. Coupled to **517**, **not** 515 |
| **P4** | **confirmed; mechanism refined** | Custom Gradle task + `gradle/class-size-exceptions.txt` (ratchet); not ArchUnit / not PMD annotation. `@SuppressWarnings` grandfathering is barred by CLAUDE.md:32 |
| **P5** | **confirmed** | ADR-0014 binding; no investigation needed |

### Cross-cutting findings (apply to multiple principles)

1. **Coupling map updated.** Replace the body's "P3 coupled to
   tempdoc 515" with "P3 coupled to tempdoc 517." 515 is structurally
   distinct (Head-side registration + getter sprawl, not setter
   fan-out) and must decompose independently.

2. **P1 needs a coordination shape, not just extraction.** The
   refined slice scope is: introduce a `BatchStats` value object +
   `ExtractedBatch` / `WriteOutcome` / `ExtractionOutcome` tagged
   types + `LedgerEntryFactory` + `StaleSourceHandler` + a small
   commit-driver event surface (`withNrtSuspended`, `CommitCompleted`)
   alongside the five named collaborators. The new types are not a P5
   violation — they are *named pieces of the state machine's data
   flow*, not pluggable strategies.

3. **P2's invariant test is two-tier.** Tier A in worker-services
   (cheap, catches reset/counter bugs); Tier B in system-tests
   (one IsolatedBackendFixture test, catches the multi-process
   restart class). Both must be green before P2 lands.

4. **P4 requires building new infrastructure (~50 LOC of Gradle
   convention + an exception file).** No existing file-LOC mechanism
   in the codebase; the recommended task is novel. Implementing this
   is its own small slice.

5. **The slice scope is larger than the body implied.** The body's
   "~300 LOC residue" + "single deps record" + "ArchUnit rule"
   underestimated the actual work. Realistic refined scope: ~480 LOC
   residue, 7-of-13 setters collapse, 6 dirty-seam coordination hooks,
   a custom Gradle task, two-tier restart test, plus the 43-row perf
   constraint register to preserve. None of the principles is refuted;
   the *cost* is higher than the body suggested.

The audit has not reduced any principle to "skip this." P1, P2, P3,
P4, P5 all remain in scope. The audit's role is to surface what the
slice agent will hit on day one so they can plan accordingly rather
than discover it mid-implementation.

## Appendix B — Implementation status after autonomous overnight run (2026-05-18)

The slice DAG from `C:/Users/<user>/.claude/plans/snug-wobbling-falcon.md`
was executed in `worktree-516-foundation`. Six slices landed cleanly;
three remain. This appendix records what shipped, what's deferred,
and why.

### Shipped (six commits on `worktree-516-foundation`)

| Slice | Commit | LOC delta on IndexingLoop.java | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Class-size rule + ratchet (P4) | `3494c840c` | n/a | green; **22 grandfathered files** seeded (tempdoc 512 §B3 audit had undercounted by 6× — 19 more violators surfaced when the rule landed) |
| 1 — Regression-net tests | `d63c40dd2` | n/a | green |
| 2 — Typed state machine (P2) | `9ab0aa031` | n/a | green; wire-string preserved via `Enum.name()` JLS guarantee |
| 3 — Substrate types for P1 | `259860b9a` | 1955 → 1945 (-10) | green |
| 4a.1 — IngestionOutcomeJournal (P1) | `94decf776` | 1945 → 1826 (-119) | green |
| 4c — EmbeddingProviderLifecycle (P1) | `5cee3fc88` | 1826 → 1689 (-137) | green |

**Cumulative reduction**: 1955 → 1689 LOC (-266, -13.6%). Grandfather
row pinned at 1689. Worktree branch ready for merge to `main`.

**Closure criteria status:**
- ✅ `enum LoopState` defined; no `STATE_*` String constants remain.
- ✅ Tests green: worker-services, indexer-worker, adapters-lucene.
- ✅ `checkClassSize` green; ratchet enforced.
- ❌ IndexingLoop ≤ 1,000 LOC. **Actual: 1689.** Blocked by deferred
  slices (4a.2/4a.3 would remove ~620 LOC; 4d would remove ~150 LOC).
- ❌ Grandfather row removed for IndexingLoop. Blocked by the LOC gap.
- ❌ No setters outside typed registry. Blocked by Slice 5 (P3).
- 🟡 43 perf-tuning constraints preserved — *partial*: constraints
  in extracted collaborators (Journal, EmbeddingProviderLifecycle)
  preserved by careful method moves + critical-analysis pass. The
  constraints in NOT-YET-EXTRACTED code (extract+write path, backfill
  scheduler) still live in IndexingLoop residue, unchanged.

### Deferred — three slices, all with the same blocker

**Blocker (`missing service` per the user's infeasibility criterion):**
the shared dev-runner was held by a different Claude Code session
(`agentSessionId 872d4d2e-...` vs my `fd72fabb-...`) for the duration
of this overnight run. Per the user's authorization scope, I could not
displace the other agent. Per the user's directive "Live verification
is part of the work. Do not mark any slice status: implemented without
live-stack verification" — the three highest-risk remaining slices
were judged unsafe to ship without the Tier-3 gate, where "high-risk"
means "subtle behavior bugs that unit tests cannot catch but live
ingestion would."

| Slice | Scope | LOC out | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4a.2 + 4a.3 — Extract+Write extraction | JobBatchExtractor + JobBatchWriter (+ StaleSnapshotResolver shared helper) — primary indexing pipeline, ~620 LOC | -620 | HIGH risk: this is the path every ingested file traverses. The dirty-seam state (`indexedSinceCommit`, batch counters, `pendingMarkDone`, the cross-seam `handleStaleAfterSnapshot` re-check at both extract and write boundaries) needs a return-outcomes contract + outcome-tagged callbacks. The substrate is shipped (Slice 3) but the wiring requires careful Tier-3 ingestion to confirm no subtle drift in counter accounting, drain ordering, or stale-source handling. Without Tier-3 the unit tests cover the major paths but not the perf-tuning constraints (#5/#29/#32 migration-active inline embedding, #11 rebuild-stamp commit, #41 resetForProfiling cross-collaborator reset) that span the seam. |
| 4d — BackfillScheduler | Idle-branch sequencing + tight-loop NRT suspend/resume + SPLADE interleave timing, ~150 LOC | -150 | MEDIUM risk: the substrate is shipped (`commitOps.withNrtSuspended` in Slice 3) but the scheduler holds load-bearing perf-tuning constraints (#14 active-vs-idle pacing, #15 combined backfill, #16 tight loop saving ~91s/97 batches, #18 interrupt policy, #20 chunk tight loop, #21 NER gating, #22 SPLADE relaxation, #23 disambiguation gating, #36 exponential backoff). Tier-3 with `jseval --pipeline` ingestion is the only way to confirm timing parity. |
| 5 — P3 construction record + typed registry | `IndexingLoopDependencies` record + `EncoderBindings` registry; spans IndexingLoop + SearchOrchestrator | n/a (structural) | MEDIUM risk: cross-touches two central coordinators (516 + 517) + their shared composition root (`DefaultWorkerAppServices`). The async model-load lifecycle (DeferredRuntime → upgradeWriter → initDeferredModels) needs Tier-3 to confirm gRPC readiness still fires at the documented ~6s / ~38s cadence and that the registry's `.bind*()` callbacks fire in the correct order post-upgrade. |

Slice 6 (remove IndexingLoop grandfather row) is trivial cleanup
gated by Slice 4a.2/4a.3 reducing the file ≤ 1,000 LOC.

### Self-imposed rules I changed during execution

(Per the user's directive "Plans written in plan mode are working
hypotheses, not contracts. Change self-imposed rules when they
conflict with this prompt or with sound evidence.")

1. **Pass-8 second-agent verification → critical-analysis pass.** No
   other agent available; substituted CLAUDE.md's critical-analysis
   discipline. Every behavioral slice's commit message ends with an
   explicit "Critical-analysis pass" section walking the diff for
   wrong-gate / wrong-flag / test-precision / cross-cutting state
   bugs.
2. **Slice 4a sub-divided into 4a.1 (Journal) + 4a.2/3 (Extract+Write).**
   The Appendix A.1 dirty-seam audit's "extract three collaborators
   together" was based on cross-seam coupling analysis; in practice
   the Journal was cleanly isolable (its state — `pendingMarkDone` —
   doesn't span beyond ledger drain), so I shipped it independently
   to reduce per-commit risk.
3. **Tier-3 deferred for slices where dev-runner contention blocked
   it.** The user's directive made Tier-3 mandatory; the contention
   was the specific blocker the user named as "infeasibility". I
   continued shipping where unit-test coverage + critical analysis
   gave high confidence (Journal, EmbeddingLifecycle), and stopped
   where they didn't (Extract+Write, Backfill scheduler).
4. **Slice 4a.2/4a.3 collapsed into "Extract+Write" considered as
   one unit then deferred.** Appendix A.1 considered both options
   (two separate collaborators vs one combined pipeline); I chose
   to defer rather than ship either without Tier-3. The substrate
   from Slice 3 makes both shapes possible when implementation
   resumes.

### What the next implementing agent should do

Pre-flight:
- Confirm dev-runner is idle (`mcp__justsearch-dev__justsearch_dev_quick_health`).
  If another agent holds it, escalate to the user before proceeding —
  Tier-3 is mandatory for the remaining slices.
- Build the worktree's dist:
  `./gradlew.bat :modules:ui:installDist :modules:indexer-worker:installDist`.

Recommended order:
1. **Slice 4a.2 + 4a.3** (~3-4 hours). Choice point: ship as one
   `JobBatchPipeline` class (faster, lower-decomposition) OR as two
   separate `JobBatchExtractor` + `JobBatchWriter` (slower, cleaner).
   I'd take the two-class option if time allows — it's the design
   Appendix A.1 actually prescribed. Either way: handleStaleAfterSnapshot
   needs to be a shared helper (both extract path and write path call
   it). Tier-3: small `jseval` ingestion against scifact.
2. **Slice 4d** (~1-2 hours). Tier-3: `jseval --pipeline` to confirm
   timing parity with Slice 4c baseline.
3. **Slice 5** (~1-2 hours). Touches SearchOrchestrator (517) as
   byproduct. Tier-3: dev-stack cold start + AI activation, confirm
   gRPC readiness + upgradeWriter flow + lifecycle.bind callbacks.
4. **Slice 6** (5 min). Verify IndexingLoop ≤ 1000 LOC, delete its
   grandfather row.

The substrate from Slice 3 is already in place: `ExtractedJob`,
`ExtractionOutcome`, `WriteOutcome`, `BatchStats`, `LedgerEntryFactory`,
`StaleSourceHandler`, `IngestionOutcomeJournal`, `EmbeddingProviderLifecycle`,
plus `CommitOps.withNrtSuspended` + `CommitOps.CommitCompletedListener`.
The extract+write extraction needs only to wire to these existing
types — no new substrate.

### Honesty notes

- The "single Claude Code session" premise the user set at the start
  of the overnight run was contradicted by the appearance of agent
  session `872d4d2e` partway through. The user may want to investigate
  what triggered the second session and whether the dev-runner's
  shared-lease model needs a stricter exclusion mode for autonomous
  overnight work.
- The unrelated `synonyms.de.v1.txt` / `synonyms.en.v1.txt` files in
  `modules/adapters-lucene/src/main/resources/SSOT/catalogs/` show as
  modified periodically (dev-stack analyzer-reload write-back).
  Reverted before every commit in this run. Worth investigating whether
  this is intentional or a bug. **W1.6 (2026-05-18):** logged in
  `docs/observations.md`.

## Appendix C — Post-implementation critical analysis + fixes (2026-05-18, two waves)

A self-critical review of the 6-slice Appendix B run surfaced ~15
findings. Two waves of fixes shipped (commits `a10f5d49b`
and `6dfc06725`).

### Wave 1 — Cheap-safe fixes (commit `a10f5d49b`)

| ID | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| W1.1 | `CommitCompletedListener` rebuild-stamp guard — short-circuit `refreshStoredFingerprintAfterCommit` on `INDEXING_LOOP_REBUILD_STAMP` to restore pre-Slice-4c semantics (the rebuild path uses `onFingerprintStamped` exclusively) | Critical (closes the only Tier-3-flagged subtle change) |
| W1.2 | `getJournal()` + `getEmbeddingLifecycle()` → package-private; sibling-package test (`AdversarialCorpusIngestionTest`) uses reflection via `setAccessible(true)` | High (encapsulation) |
| W1.3 | Renamed `journal.failure(...)` → `journal.outcome(...)` (also used for SKIPPED_POLICY which isn't a failure) | Medium |
| W1.4 | Typed `LoopState` migration: `KnowledgeServer:1127` + `GrpcHealthService` fallback → `LoopState.X.name()` references; `getCurrentState()` `@Deprecated(since="tempdoc 516 Slice 2")` | Medium |
| W1.5 | Inlined `extractContent` + `validateArtifact` 3-line wrappers | Low |
| W1.6 | Synonym CRLF drift logged in `docs/observations.md` | Polish |
| W1.7 | PMD drift fix verified: PMD runs at `7.16.0` per `externalInfoUrl` in violation report; 9 pre-existing violations in untouched files | Polish |

### Wave 2 — Structural fixes (commit `6dfc06725`)

| ID | Fix | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| W2.1 | Dropped internal `embeddingProvider()` + `allowEmbeddingWrites()` wrappers on IndexingLoop; ~20 callers updated to `embeddingLifecycle.X()` directly | Medium |
| W2.2 | **`IndexingLoopRestartTest`** — closes the Slice 1 gap with two real-thread tests that exercise start → idle → close cycles on fresh and sequential IndexingLoop instances (the 403 Tier C bug class at unit level) | Critical (fills Slice 1 gap) |
| W2.3 | `CommitOpsTest` extended with 4 new `CommitCompletedListener` tests: fires-after-success-with-reason, doesn't-fire-on-failure, swallows-listener-exception, null-clears | Polish |
| W2.4 | `CheckClassSizeTask` stale-row → build failure (was log-only). Caught my own W1.4 KnowledgeServer LOC regression on first run | High (enforcement gap) |
| W2.5 | C-018 governance javadoc on `ExtractionOutcome` + `WriteOutcome` (substrate-awaiting-consumer markers) | High |
| W2.6 | `StaleSourceHandler.deleteMissingSource` isolation test (Appendix A.7 gap) | Low |

### Wave 3 — Tier-3-gated work: STRUCTURALLY BLOCKED

Two compounding blockers prevent Tier-3 verification of any shipped
slice in this environment:

1. **Dev-runner launches from `F:/JustSearch/modules/ui/build/install/ui/`
   regardless of caller CWD.** Even when `installDist` runs in the
   worktree (build output goes to
   `worktree/modules/ui/build/install/ui/`), the dev-runner reads from
   the main-repo install path. Confirmed by inspecting
   `backend.stderr.log`:
   `protobuf-java-4.33.5.jar (file:/F:/JustSearch/modules/ui/build/install/ui/lib/...)`.
   No `start` MCP parameter overrides this. To run worktree code on
   the dev stack would require clobbering main's install dir — out
   of authorization scope for an autonomous run.
2. **Worker doesn't reach `READY` on this machine.** Even with the
   main repo's stale dist, the worker stays at
   `lifecycle.state=STARTING, reason=worker.starting` indefinitely.
   Reproduced across 5+ distinct stack-start attempts in this and
   the previous overnight run, across 4 different agent sessions
   (`fd72fabb`, `872d4d2e`, `0166f651`, `5fe9572d`). Pre-existing
   environment condition; **agent-lessons.md** documents `~38s to
   worker ready` as the expected baseline, so this is anomalous.
   Worth investigating separately; not caused by tempdoc 516 work.

### What Wave 3 would have covered if unblocked

- **W3.1 Tier-3 verification batch** for shipped Slices 2 / 4a.1 / 4c.
- **W3.2 Slice 4a.2 + 4a.3** (Extract + Write extraction).
- **W3.3 Slice 4d** (BackfillScheduler).
- **W3.4 Slice 5** (P3 construction).
- **W3.5 Slice 6** (cleanup; remove IndexingLoop grandfather row).

### Substitute verification used in lieu of Tier-3

For each behavioral slice (2, 4a.1, 4c), the Tier-3 risk was either:
- **JLS-guaranteed identical** (Slice 2 wire strings — `Enum.name()`
  returns the literal constant name);
- **Verbatim port confirmed by line-by-line critical analysis** (Slice
  4a.1 drain semantics; Slice 4c GPU handoff + listener fan-out);
- **Closed by a subsequent fix** (Slice 4c's listener-after-rebuild-
  stamp was the only speculative subtle change — closed by W1.1's
  rebuild-stamp guard).

Plus W2.2's `IndexingLoopRestartTest` retroactively reduces risk on
4a.1 + 4c by exercising the runLoop thread at unit level.

This is not a full Tier-3 substitute, but it's the strongest
verification available without dev-runner access to the worktree's
dist + a worker that reaches READY.

### Closure status

- **Shipped (8 commits on `worktree-516-foundation`):** Slice 0, 1,
  2, 3, 4a.1, 4c, plus Wave 1 + Wave 2 critical-analysis fixes +
  Appendix B/C documentation.
- **IndexingLoop LOC**: 1955 → 1689 (Slice 4c) → 1687 (W1.5 inline)
  → 1666 (W2.1 wrapper removal). The closure criterion (≤ 1000 LOC)
  is **not met** without the deferred 4a.2/4a.3/4d slices.
- **Deferred (in `worktree-516-foundation`'s grandfather list):**
  IndexingLoop pinned at 1666; SearchOrchestrator at 1919;
  AppFacadeBootstrap at 2823.
- **Next session's first move:** investigate the worker-startup
  environment issue (Blocker #2) — it's pre-existing and blocks any
  future Tier-3 work, not just tempdoc 516's. Then proceed with the
  deferred W3 slices.

### W4 attempted (2026-05-18 follow-up) — Tier-3 unblock fails on a deeper environment bug

A second pass attempted the Wave 4 unblock procedure per the plan
(`C:/Users/<user>/.claude/plans/snug-wobbling-falcon.md`). Outcome:

1. **Worktree dist copied over main install path** — succeeded
   (PowerShell `Copy-Item -Recurse -Force`).
2. **Stack started with `skipBuild: true`** — succeeded; head READY.
3. **Force-reindex via `POST /api/operations/core.reindex/invoke`** —
   FAILED with `errorCode: CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE, capability:
   worker-online`. The `core.reindex` operation requires the worker
   to already be ONLINE (per `OperationExecutorImpl.java:321-335` +
   `RequiredCapability.WorkerOnline`). Chicken-and-egg: the API
   intended to unblock the worker requires the worker to be unblocked
   first.
4. **Fallback: fresh `dataDir` (no BLOCKED_LEGACY) via
   `mcp__justsearch-dev__justsearch_dev_start` with `dataDir:
   F:/JustSearch/tmp/dev-tier3-516`** — stack started; worker still
   STARTING after 60s+. Investigation:
   - `docCount: 0`, `compatibility: ""` (no BLOCKED_LEGACY — fresh)
   - `indexHealthy: false`, `indexState: PENDING`
   - **`meta.workerRpcStale: true`** even with fresh `workerRpcAtMs`
     timestamp
   - This is a DEEPER bug than the BLOCKED_LEGACY gate: the Head's
     gRPC status call to the Worker isn't completing (or returning
     stale/empty data). Reproduces independent of data-dir state.

**Definitive blocker.** The Tier-3 unblock path documented in W4.1
relied on the BLOCKED_LEGACY → REBUILDING transition (auto-triggered
or API-triggered) flipping `indexHealthy` to true. With an empty
fresh data dir, BLOCKED_LEGACY doesn't even apply but `indexHealthy`
STAYS false because the underlying worker-status RPC plumbing doesn't
work in this environment.

This is the same chronic environment condition documented earlier
(worker never reaches READY) but at a deeper layer: the issue is in
the worker-status RPC chain, not specifically embedding compat.

**Per the plan's stop condition** ("If W4.1 fails. Stop. Document
the new blocker. Don't proceed to Waves 5-7 without Tier-3 access"),
Waves 5–8 stay deferred. Closing the autonomous run at this point
is the right call — Wave 5 (Extract+Write extraction, ~620 LOC out)
is HIGH-risk on the primary indexing path; shipping it without
Tier-3 against a faulty environment would be flying double-blind.

**What the user can do to unblock this for the next session:**
- Investigate why `workerRpcStale: true` even with fresh state. Likely
  candidates: the Worker's status-RPC handler (`GrpcHealthService` +
  `IndexStatusOps.fillStatus`), the gRPC channel between Head and
  Worker, or the status-cache/poller in the Head.
- Once `workerRpcStale: false` and `indexHealthy: true` on a fresh
  data dir, re-run W4.1 with confidence. The substrate + plan from
  `C:/Users/<user>/.claude/plans/snug-wobbling-falcon.md` is ready for
  Waves 5–8 to pick up.

**State after W4 attempt:** identical to before — no code changes
shipped from this attempt; the dist-copy in step 1 is just build
artifacts (regenerable on next `gradlew installDist`).

### Wave 5 / 6 / 7.1 / 8 — shipped after user override of W4 stop condition (2026-05-18 continuation)

The user explicitly authorized proceeding past the W4 Tier-3 stop
("proceed" + "do not defer for substantial work" + "prefer the better
long-term answer"). Waves 5/6/7.1/8 shipped against unit-test +
static verification only — Tier-3 stays blocked at the environment
level, NOT at the code level.

**Slices shipped**

- **Wave 5 (Slice 4a.2 + 4a.3, two commits)** — extracted
  `JobBatchWriter`, `StaleSnapshotResolver`, `JobBatchExtractor` into
  `loop/`. The full extract → batch-embed → write pipeline is now a
  3-collaborator orchestration in `IndexingLoop.processBatchInner`
  (~30 LOC). IndexingLoop: 1666 → 1352 LOC (−314).
- **Wave 6 (Slice 4d, one commit)** — extracted `BackfillScheduler`
  into `loop/`. Owns the idle-branch backfill orchestration (combined
  enrichment tight loop + per-stage fallback + disambiguation gating)
  + interleaved-SPLADE timing + SPLADE retry-backoff state +
  disambiguation completion latch + the 5 backfill batch-size
  constants. IndexingLoop: 1352 → 993 LOC (−361). **Closure criterion
  (≤ 1000 LOC) MET in W6.**
- **Wave 7.1 (P2 named transitions, one commit)** — three private
  wrappers (`transitionToRunning/Idle/Paused`) over the existing
  `setCurrentState` sink. State graph is now `grep transitionTo`-able.
  4 callsites switched.
- **Wave 8 (Slice 6 closure, this commit)** — grandfather row
  removed from `gradle/class-size-exceptions.txt`. Closure block
  added to this Appendix.

**Wave 7.2 (P3 EncoderBindings) — SHIPPED with Tier-3 verification**

User overrode the earlier defer decision; W7.2 shipped after the
Tier-3 environment unblocked on a fresh dist install.

Scope (narrowed from the plan's "all 13 setters"): the 4
async-loaded encoders/services that genuinely needed mutable
post-ctor surface — SpladeEncoder, BgeM3Encoder, NerService,
DisambiguationService. These were the symmetric pairs on
IndexingLoop + SearchOrchestrator that DWAS's `wireX` methods
fanned across. Consolidated into a single shared `EncoderBindings`
registry held by both consumer classes.

Out of scope for this commit (deferred to a future tempdoc):
- The 5 startup-config setters (`setDetailedTracing`,
  `setPathResolutionStore`, `setMigrationActiveSupplier`,
  `setCommitMetadataSupplier`, `setEmbeddingTelemetryEvents`) —
  set-once-at-startup, not async-swappable; record-pattern
  decomposition is its own structural improvement.
- The 4 `EmbeddingProviderLifecycle`-delegate setters
  (`setEmbeddingProvider`, `setEmbeddingProviderChangeListener`,
  `addEmbeddingProviderChangeListener`,
  `setEmbeddingCompatController`) — already delegates to a
  collaborator (Slice 4c). The collaborator already encapsulates
  the swap path.

Tier-3 verification (NEW — env unblocked this session):
- Fresh dev stack against `tmp/dev-tier3-516-w72` with `ready_worker:
  true`. The prior `workerRpcStale` blocker (commit a7ea6fdab)
  cleared after a fresh `installDist` — likely a stale jar artifact
  from the prior session.
- Ingested 3 docs; observed via `/api/status.worker`:
  `embeddingCompleted: 8/8`, `spladeCompleted: 8/8`,
  `nerCompleted: 48`, `chunkEmbeddingCompleted: 40/40`. Each
  statistic proves the corresponding `EncoderBindings.xxx()`
  supplier was read at the right moment by `BackfillScheduler`.
- HYBRID search returned 8 hits in 395 ms — proves
  `SearchOrchestrator.encoderBindings.spladeEncoder()` returns the
  bound encoder via the shared registry.
- No exceptions in backend logs.
- AI chat activation failed (no chat-LLM model imported in fresh
  data dir) — unrelated to W7.2 (chat LLM is separate from the
  encoders W7.2 affects).

**Closure**

| Closure criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| IndexingLoop ≤ 1000 LOC | ✅ | 993 LOC (W6) |
| Grandfather row removed | ✅ | this commit (W8) |
| P1 collaborator extraction | ✅ | Journal (4a.1), Writer (4a.2), Extractor (4a.3), EmbeddingProviderLifecycle (4c), BackfillScheduler (4d) |
| P2 named transitions | ✅ | W7.1 |
| P3 setter elimination (async-load encoders, 4 setters) | ✅ | W7.2 — EncoderBindings registry; Tier-3-verified |
| P3 setter elimination (startup config, 3 setters) | ✅ | W7.2 followup — IndexingLoopOptions record; Tier-3-verified |
| P3 setter elimination (lifecycle delegates, 4 setters) | ✅ | W7.2 followup — callers reach lifecycle via getEmbeddingLifecycle() |
| P3 setter elimination (last 2 — migrationActiveSupplier, embeddingTelemetryEvents) | ✅ | W7.2 final cut — KS pre-wires both via newAppServices() helper at DWAS-ctor; lambda safe because it reads captured KS fields at call time, telemetry value already set at KS:331 before DWAS ctor; Tier-3-verified |
| P4 ratchet trip-wire | ✅ | Slice 0 — live + proven (caught W1.4 regression) |
| P5 boundary (concrete classes, not strategy ifaces) | ✅ | All 5 extracted collaborators are concrete final classes |

**Residual work**

- ~~2 retained setters~~ — eliminated in the W7.2 final cut. The
  earlier "out of 516 scope, KS bootstrap reordering required"
  framing was wrong. Re-examining KS init revealed: (a) the
  migration lambda just needs KS.this to exist (captures + reads
  fields at CALL time, not creation time), and (b) embeddingTelemetry
  is set at KS:331 already, well before DWAS-ctor at KS:594. Both
  flow through cleanly via a new KS.newAppServices() helper +
  DWAS's 2-arg ctor.
- The chronic `workerRpcStale` env bug from the W4 attempt has not
  recurred this session — root-cause investigation deferred (fresh
  `installDist` resolved it all three Tier-3 attempts; the trigger
  appears to be a stale-jar artifact from a prior session). Track
  in observations.md if it resurfaces.
- SearchOrchestrator decomposition (pinned at 1923 LOC after W7.2's
  ctor expansion) — its own tempdoc (523).
- AppFacadeBootstrap decomposition (pinned at 2823 LOC) — its own
  tempdoc (524).

## Appendix D — merge to main + post-merge defect cleanup (2026-05-19)

(Folded in from short-lived tempdocs 525 + 526, which should have been
appendices to begin with — small follow-up work belongs in the parent
tempdoc, not in fresh tempdocs of its own.)

### D.1 — Merge to main

Merge-base = `b0c220add` (origin/main); local main HEAD had moved to
`38233ec58` from parallel work (517 search-execution, 518 inference
lifecycle, 521 plugin substrate). Predicted 4 conflicts in 525's plan;
hit 6 during the actual merge:

| File | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `SearchOrchestrator.java` | Took main's post-517 thin facade (144 LOC); re-applied W7.2 EncoderBindings cut on top. 517 itself had flagged this exact change as "Phase 2 SearchCollaboratorsHolder migration deferred" — W7.2 IS that Phase 2. |
| `gradle/class-size-exceptions.txt` | Combined both deltas; removed IndexingLoop row (closure); removed SearchOrchestrator row (post-517 ≤ 200 LOC); kept 518's inference section; KS pin 1989; bumped pre-existing main values for AppFacadeBootstrap (2837) and AgentLoopService (2529). |
| `build-logic/.../CheckClassSizeTask.kt` | Kept HEAD's W2.4 promotion of stale rows from WARN to FAIL. |
| `build.gradle.kts` | Kept main's combined "518 P5 / 516 P4" comment label. |
| `docs/observations.md` | Union of both sides' entries. |
| `docs/tempdocs/516-indexingloop-size.md` | Kept all body additions; dropped conflict markers. |

Two post-merge defect baked into the merge commit (not introduced by
the merge, surfaced by it):

- `UnreferencedCodeTest`: 4 allowlist entries for 517's static delegates
  (`SearchOrchestrator.deriveActualMode` / `deriveEffectiveMode` /
  `modeToDefaultPipeline` + `SearchExecutor.hitCount`) — called from
  worker-services tests, invisible from app-launcher's classpath.
- `AgentEventSealedTest`: bumped expected permitted-subtype count
  15→16 (pre-existing stale assertion, already filed in observations.md).

Verification: full unit suite + checkClassSize green; Tier-3 live-stack
run (7/7 docs indexed, 7/7 splade, 43 NER, 36/36 chunk-embed, HYBRID 7
hits in 358ms). Merge commit `3eea11b67`; pushed to
`origin/main` as `b0c220add..3eea11b67`.

### D.2 — Post-merge defect cleanup: jseval + UI revival

Validation of the merged main via `python -m jseval run` and live
browser walk surfaced **two pre-existing bugs from the 502 series
"eliminate late-binding" refactor** (2026-05-17 — predates 516). Same
family, same fix shape, same `standalone-capability-stays-stuck` pattern
that this tempdoc's W7.2 work explicitly addressed elsewhere.

**D.2.F1 — `IndexingController` stale-capture.** The 502 refactor
injected `IndexingService` by value into `IndexingController`'s ctor at
`LocalApiServer:238`. Worker comes up async after `LocalApiServer`
construction in eval/headless mode, so the controller captured the
`unavailable()` sentinel for the process lifetime. `POST
/api/indexing/roots` returned 500 → blocked `jseval` at the first
ingest call.

Fix: `Supplier<IndexingService>` capture. `LocalApiServer:243` now
passes `b.appFacade::indexing`; each handler resolves on each call.
`AppFacade.indexing()` already resolves laterally (returns current
value or sentinel), so the swap in
`AppFacadeBootstrap.connectKnowledgeServer` becomes visible without a
setter or listener. 12 test ctor sites in `IndexingControllerExcludesApplyTest`
wrap with `() -> indexing`. Commit `4e3808888`.

Verification: full `python -m jseval run --dataset scifact --modes
lexical,hybrid --pipeline --start-backend --clean --max-queries 50`
PASSED in 7 min. Lexical nDCG@10=0.774, hybrid nDCG@10=0.820, both
`comparable=True`. All 8 projections clean (contract_violations,
bootstrap_ci, cpu_fallback_counts, encoder_drift, rank_diff,
rate_timeline, stratified_metrics, lucene_runtime_telemetry). 5,184
docs in 92s = 56 docs/sec exercising the full
`JobBatchExtractor → JobBatchWriter → BackfillScheduler` chain.

**D.2.F2 — `DocumentService` stale-capture (×3 controllers).** Same
pattern as F1, but on `DocumentService` in 3 controllers:
`PreviewController`, `ChunkInfoController`, `RetrieveContextController`.
Clicking an Inspector result in the browser → Preview pane → "HTTP 500"
(`UnsupportedOperationException: Document service not configured`).

Fix: `Supplier<DocumentService>` in all 3 controllers, back-compat
`DocumentService`-taking ctors that wrap with `() -> documentService`
so existing tests (12 in `PreviewControllerTest`) compile unchanged.
`LocalApiServer` passes `b.appFacade::documents`. Commit `3c3f545d6`.

Verification: live Chrome walk via the MCP browser tools — Library →
Add Folder `F:\JustSearch\docs\reference` (45 files queued, F1 path) →
wait for backfill → Search "class-size standard" (24 results, 4ms) →
click result → Inspector → Preview pane renders the actual markdown
(`/api/preview` = 200) → activate AI (Qwen3.5 cuda12) → "What is the
class size standard?" → streaming Document Q&A with 5 cited sources.
Full RAG path live end-to-end.

### D.3 — Pattern recognition for future refactors

The 502 "eliminate late-binding" refactor pattern recurred in 4
callsites (`IndexingController`, `PreviewController`,
`ChunkInfoController`, `RetrieveContextController`). All four needed
`Supplier<X>` capture instead of value-capture; all four shipped the
same shape of bug (sentinel pinned for the process lifetime). Future
refactors removing service-locator indirection should preserve the
lazy-resolution behavior — promote `Supplier<X>` over a directly-held
value when the upstream binding is genuinely async.

This is exactly the failure mode the `standalone-capability-stays-stuck`
postmortem in `.claude/rules/agent-lessons.md` warns about. The
postmortem's exemplar (`AppFacadeBootstrap.connectKnowledgeServer`) is
the bridge itself; the F1/F2 controllers are the downstream consumers
that 502's refactor accidentally re-broke.

Tempdoc 524 (AppFacadeBootstrap decomposition) inherits the requirement
to preserve this lazy-resolution discipline through any further
collaborator extraction.

#### Family audit (2026-05-19 — closed, no further F-class bugs)

Verified each of the 6 `AppFacade` methods against the F1/F2 pattern:

| Method | Pattern | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `search(request)` | Operation, not getter — `AppFacadeBootstrap.search()` reads `this.searchPort` at call time. `searchPort` IS late-bound via `connectKnowledgeServer:1264`, but callers invoke through `appFacade.search()` which re-resolves on each call. | ✅ Safe |
| `indexing()` | Late-bound via `connectKnowledgeServer:1259`. | ✅ F1 fixed |
| `documents()` | Late-bound via `connectKnowledgeServer:1260`. | ✅ F2 ×3 fixed |
| `onlineAi()` | `private final OnlineAiService` set-once in ctor (line 349 with real impl, or line 360 with sentinel). Internal state transitions handled by `OnlineAiServiceImpl` via the `InferenceLifecycleManager` — this session's UI walk confirmed AI activation (`Offline` → `Online — Qwen3.5`) works without restarting controllers. | ✅ Safe |
| `agent()` | `private volatile AgentService` set-once in ctor (598 real, 600 sentinel). Volatile is over-defensive — there is no swap. | ✅ Safe |
| `inferenceSnapshot()` | Reads `this.inferenceManager` at call time. `inferenceManager` set once at line 346, never swapped. | ✅ Safe |

**The F1/F2 stale-capture pattern is fully contained.** Of the 6
AppFacade methods, 2 are operations that re-read fields at call time,
2 were the late-bound getters fixed by F1/F2, and 2 are set-once with
internal state machines. No more controllers need supplier-conversion.

## Closure (2026-05-18)

Marked `done` after cross-validation confirmed the issue this tempdoc
described has been substantially addressed. `IndexingLoop.java`
shrunk from 1,955 LOC → **931 LOC** — below the 1,000 LOC ceiling.

**Delivery**: ~18 sibling collaborators extracted into the `loop/`
package (`BackfillScheduler`, `JobBatchExtractor`, `JobBatchWriter`,
`EmbeddingProviderLifecycle`, `StaleSnapshotResolver`,
`SourceAdmission`, `IngestionOutcomeJournal`, `IndexingLoopOptions`,
`IndexingPipelineMetricCatalog`, etc.) plus a `loop/ops/`
subpackage (`LoopPacingPolicy`, `EmbeddingBackfillOps`).

**Invariants preserved** (cross-validated per tempdoc 512 §B3
mega-class cross-validation report):

- GPU mutex cooperation (`main_gpu_active` MMF flag) — now read via
  `LoopPacingPolicy.shouldRunBackfill(mainGpuActive, …)` and
  `EmbeddingBackfillOps:169` (`context.signalBus().isMainGpuActive()`)
- Breath-holding (user-presence pause) — `BREATH_HOLD_MS` at
  `IndexingLoop:83`, `signalBus.isUserActive()` checks across 6+
  collaborator classes
- Migration safety (`migrationActiveSupplier`) — plumbed through
  `IndexingLoopOptions` (externalized construction), wired from
  `DefaultWorkerAppServices:71,112`
- Stage telemetry (`recordStageMs`) — `IndexingLoop:407` + dedicated
  `IndexingPipelineMetricCatalog` class
- One Worker per index, commit-meta freshness — preserved by the
  surrounding architecture

Body content above preserved as design history. If the residual
931 LOC needs further compression, open a new tempdoc citing this
one by title.
